        "Question":"<p>Hey everyone,<\/p>\n<p>Like many of you, I\u2019ve been deep in the trenches of ChatGPT plugin development, and the question of monetization has been on my mind a lot lately. I think We all know about the amazing solution for monetization and authentication from PluginLab, especially for those leaning into subscriptions. But for those of us with free plugins, it\u2019s a different story.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve had some success with affiliate links in my plugins, and it\u2019s been a decent way to bring in a bit of income without setting up barriers. But I\u2019ve been wondering: What other methods are out there? I\u2019ve seen some plugins experimenting with traffic exchanges, and it\u2019s got me thinking.<\/p>\n<p>Actually, I\u2019ve been toying with the idea of creating a solution or service specifically geared towards helping with ChatGPT plugin monetization. I\u2019m still in the early stages, and I haven\u2019t built anything concrete yet. But I\u2019m genuinely interested in understanding what we, as developers, really need.<\/p>\n<p>So, if you\u2019ve got some insights, experiences, or even pain points you\u2019d like to share, I\u2019d love to chat. Whether it\u2019s about what\u2019s worked for you, what hasn\u2019t, or what you wish existed in the monetization space, let\u2019s have a conversation. Your input could help shape something that benefits all of us.<\/p>\n<p>Drop a comment below or reach out directly. Looking forward to some enlightening discussions!<\/p>\n<p>Cheers.<\/p>",

        "Question":"<p>I have pondered a lot about whether or not I should make this thread. But I will do so, since OpenAI customer service is unavailable (there is some kind of loop: FAQs invite me to start a chat with customer service from within ChatGPT; once I am in, I press the help button as instructed and am redirected to FAQs\u2026 GPT itself says I have been put in a \u201cCatch-22 situation\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>Fact is, I think that safe practices are not being enforced by OpenAI, which is itself a severe breach of their own ethical code. I have browsed time and again the plug-ins and all I could see are sloppy legal guarantees, bare minimum customer relations, and even some cases of tracking and phishing. It is usually hard to understand under which legal framework developers are releasing their work and <strong>since it is not possible to leave a review<\/strong>, the user is left to her own devices.<\/p>\n<p>I will make here some examples:<br>\n[i] <strong>This disclaimer is devoid of legal value in most countries:<\/strong> ht tps:\/\/plugin-3c56b9d4c8a6465998395f28b6a445b2-jexkai4vea-uc.a.run.app\/legal.html<br>\n[ii] <strong>(Access PDF and DOCs) Also this one:<\/strong> htt ps:\/\/pdf.accessplugins.com\/legal-info<br>\n[iii] <strong>(Ask the Code) The statements have no legal value in my country:<\/strong> ht tps:\/\/docs.askthecode.ai\/legal\/<br>\n[iv]  <strong>(Smart Slides) This plugin \"developer\u2019s page provides aboslutely no valuable context on its nature and operations:<\/strong> ht tps:\/\/smart-slides.co\/<br>\n[v]  <strong>This licence is simply non-existent:<\/strong> ht tps:\/\/chat.openai.com\/xapi.lihaorui.com\/legal<br>\n[vi] <strong>This licence is for the wrong product (ChatWithPDF instead of ChatWithVideo):<\/strong> ht tps:\/\/chatwithvideo.sdan.io\/legal<br>\n<em>(apparently, I cannot include links in my posts)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Another worrysome part of all of this is that I have no specific connections to the above plugins.

However, fact is, OpenAI cannot <em>police<\/em> all external content (and it would be beyond expectations to do so). It cannot check every single developer and every single country. And that is precisely why we need a user-driven reporting system or revieweing system to make developers accountable for what they do.<\/p>\n<p>I think I am not asking for the Moon here\u2026 just a basic Likert scale next to each item in the plugin store and a comment box.<\/p>",

Since ChatGPT is open-source and we all come from different backgrounds, not everyone here is a programmer. But we all have great ideas, right? So, why not let us add different tools, like plugins , to our GPT setups easily?<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s my case: I tried making a GPT project called Matspar Bergen, <a href=\"https:\/\/chat.openai.com\/g\/g-ikaF9gFOW-matspar-bergen\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ChatGPT - MatSpar Bergen<\/a> . The goal was to search the web for the cheapest food prices in my city. But, I found out that GPT can\u2019t do web scraping on its own. And, since I\u2019m not a programmer, paying around 50 dollars for a scraping service like ScrapingBee , <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scrapingbee.com\/#pricing\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ScrapingBee, the best web scraping API.<\/a> \u2013 and then giving away my tokens for it \u2013 doesn\u2019t really work for me. I mean, I\u2019m trying to cut down my grocery bills, not spend more on coding stuff!<\/p>\n<p>So, what do you  think, Samuel Harris Altman ? Could adding a plugin feature to GPT  help connect our cool ideas with the technical part? This could really help people like me, who aren\u2019t coders but still want to add something new and useful to our community.<\/p>\n<p>Can\u2019t wait to hear what you think!<\/p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nCarlos Carpio<\/p>",

I myself was having trouble - the API call was being refused due to a lack of an API key, even though I was including one in the Authorization section! Or so I thought\u2026<\/p>\n<p>The solution to my issue was actually pretty straightforward - using the \u201cCustom\u201d option when setting the API key. Specifically, I think that you want to make sure that the Custom field reflects whatever your API expects the key to be called, and that it matches whatever your Schema calls the key, which in my case was X-Api-Key. With just that tweak, I was off to the races! I hope this helps at least one of you.<\/p>",

Therefore have just upgraded my free tier account to the paid option for GPT-4.0. Actually with doing that I assumed I would also get an access to the usage of API Keys. But it turned out, that I still need to do a separate payment for it, which I did for 5 dollars. Now I have paid in total 25 dollars for both of the services but interestingly I see that I have a limit of 23 dollars at my usage profile in platform.openai. Therefore I am a bit confused, do I have now 23 dollars worth of API tokens, if yes why it is not 25 and how does this payments are related?<\/p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!!<br>\nMerve<\/p>",

        "Question":"<p>Hi everyone!<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been diving into the world of ChatGPT plugin development, and I recently wanted to clarify how the <code>ai-plugin.json<\/code> file and OpenAPI spec are translated into the \u201cPrompt for ChatGPT\u201d that you can find in the \u201cplugin devtools\u201d section. I thought sharing my findings with the community would be helpful, as understanding this process can be crucial for optimizing your plugin\u2019s performance and user experience.<\/p>\n<p>Although the official documentation provides a good starting point, working through these examples helped me gain deeper insights into the conversion process.<\/p>\n<p>The ChatGPT Plugin Prompt is a dynamically generated Typescript pseudo-code that acts as an interface between ChatGPT and your plugin. The <code>ai-plugin.json<\/code> file and the OpenAPI specification are essential components.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a quick summary of my findings:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>description_for_model<\/code> property in the <code>ai-plugin.json<\/code> file offers the most space (up to 8,000 characters) for the plugin prompt. However, it\u2019s crucial to make the most of other properties from the OpenAPI spec to optimize the prompt output.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Each API endpoint defined in the OpenAPI spec includes two description properties that contribute to the plugin prompt. With each description being 200-300 characters long, properly utilizing these properties can significantly increase the available prompt space.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>The OpenAPI Path Description, if available, appears immediately before the type declaration in the dynamically generated pseudo-code namespace of the plugin prompt. If the Path Description is unavailable, the OpenAPI Summary is used instead.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Only descriptions specific to <em>request properties<\/em> are included in the plugin prompt. This approach is beneficial because it provides more prompt space per component, as each description can be 200-300 characters long.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I hope this information helps those working on ChatGPT plugins to better understand the conversion process and optimize their plugin prompts!<\/p>\n<p>For a more detailed explanation, examples, and the full write-up, check out my blog post:<\/p>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https:\/\/wfhbrian.com\/mastering-chatgpt-plugins-plugin-prompt-space\/\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/original\/3X\/d\/b\/db0c00f525a7c7007d0c22ed8bf0abc41b03a573.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"87A650\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\">\n\n      <a href=\"https:\/\/wfhbrian.com\/mastering-chatgpt-plugins-plugin-prompt-space\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" title=\"11:31PM - 01 May 2023\">WFH Brian \u2013 1 May 23<\/a>\n  <\/header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690\/388;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/optimized\/3X\/8\/7\/87a577725be64627b9534a0bfac0e49f11f5feca_2_690x388.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"40404B\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/optimized\/3X\/8\/7\/87a577725be64627b9534a0bfac0e49f11f5feca_2_690x388.jpeg, https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/optimized\/3X\/8\/7\/87a577725be64627b9534a0bfac0e49f11f5feca_2_1035x582.jpeg 1.5x, https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/original\/3X\/8\/7\/87a577725be64627b9534a0bfac0e49f11f5feca.jpeg 2x\"><\/div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/wfhbrian.com\/mastering-chatgpt-plugins-plugin-prompt-space\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mastering ChatGPT Plugins: Optimizing Prompt Space in the Dynamic Plugin...<\/a><\/h3>\n\n  <p>Optimizing the Plugin Prompt\u2014the generated interface that explains your plugin to ChatGPT\u2014can significantly enhance your ChatGPT plugin's performance.

        "Question":"<p>I\u2019m posting this in the community forum because 1) I don\u2019t use the public facing ChatGPT service so I\u2019m not a plugin user, and 2) this is purely my opinion on the value of plugins in-general based on my initial observations (and 9 years of building chat bots.)<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>If we think of plugins as the LLM equivalent of phone apps I think they can be made to work. An individual user needs to hand curate the plugins they use in much the same way you hand curate the apps installed on your phone. There will be 20 different plugins that know how to talk to a PDF so you can\u2019t just let the system pick one at random. The user needs to select their PDF plugin of choice.<\/li>\n<li>This promise being promoted that you can take any API and map it into a plugin by simply adding a manifest is just that a promise and a false one at that. Your plugin API needs to be hand crafted for whatever experience you\u2019re exposing to the user. Simple GET based API\u2019s might result in an ok experience but these models don\u2019t understand about multi-turn experiences where you need to collect more information before calling a given API. These 1st gen plugin experiences are exactly that. They\u2019re 1st gen. They have a long way to go to be what I would consider truly conversational.<\/li>\n<li>If we\u2019re thinking about plugins as being the chat equivalent of phone apps then what we should really be talking about are multi-turn agents, not plugins. You want to launch an interactive conversation with an Agent that you\u2019ve hand curated in the same way you hand curate the apps on your phone. Plugins aren\u2019t that experience. I\u2019m sorry, they\u2019re not\u2026<\/li>\n<\/ol>",

        "Question":"<p>Hey developers! For those who are struggling (especially beginners) with ChatGPT plugin development and find the official documentation lacking, I wrote a comprehensive tutorial on how to build a simple ChatGPT plugin. You can read it <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.to\/mmz001\/chatgpt-plugin-development-tutorial-4p4d\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In my tutorial, I\u2019ve outlined how you can structure your plugin for an improved developer experience. In particular, I show how you can leverage FastAPI\u2019s automatic OpenAPI schema generation for faster prototyping. For example, I explain how you can generate descriptions for your endpoints directly from your code\u2014no manual editing of the OpenAPI spec. I also go explain in-depth how you can install your localhost plugin in ChatGPT.<\/p>\n<p>I hope this tutorial is helpful for everyone!
