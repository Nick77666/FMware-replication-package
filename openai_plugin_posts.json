        "Question":"<p>The GPT Store search acts strange or I don\u2019t know how to properly use it.<\/p>\n<p>If I type a partial word, sometimes it will find GPTs, sometimes it won\u2019t until you type in a full word.<br>\nSome of my GPTs that are not public appear in search results. But not all. How?<br>\nWhen I search for one of my GPTs that IS public, it always shows at top. I assume that is specific to each individual. In other words, I have no way to know where it appears in search results for other users, just that it is always <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1<\/span> for me.<br>\nShould we pack our GPT name and description with lots of relevant keywords to get it to show up more? Use generic GPT names instead of unique ones?<\/p>",
        "Replies":"<p>First, you are correct, your GPTs will show first in a search that you run, even non-public GPTs (though these won\u2019t show for others).<\/p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"mojave\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"584965\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"><\/div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https:\/\/sea2.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/user_avatar\/community.openai.com\/mojave\/48\/165646_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> mojave:<\/div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If I type a partial word, sometimes it will find GPTs, sometimes it won\u2019t until you type in a full word.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/aside>\n<p>Maybe it\u2019s just pulling too many results on the partial word match so they\u2019ve made the choice not to display any results until the lost is further winnowed down?<\/p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"mojave\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"584965\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"><\/div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https:\/\/sea2.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/user_avatar\/community.openai.com\/mojave\/48\/165646_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> mojave:<\/div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Should we pack our GPT name and description with lots of relevant keywords to get it to show up more? Use generic GPT names instead of unique ones?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/aside>\n<p>No. That will likely be a great way to get delisted. OpenAI already dealt with this with the plugins store and plugins named <strong>aaaaaardvarkAI<\/strong> just trying to hit the front page of the alphabetical listing.<\/p>\n<p>Just name your GPT appropriately for what it does, don\u2019t worry about SEO.<\/p>\n<p>If it does something unique and novel that people want to do, users will find it. If it does the same thing that 200 other GPTs do, fighting for mindshare is a losing battle.<\/p>\n<p>I have published 4 GPTs publicly several days ago and no one has used them at all, i doubt anyone even knows they exist. The search function is really bad. It only displays 10-12 results and it often does not display GPTs related to a key word which forces users to know what they want by name to find something. It\u2019s not just that no one can find my GPTs in the GPT Store though, i looked up the exact names of my GPTs using inurl: and they don\u2019t even show up on google. I absolutely have published them publicly without issue. I have gotten no indication that there is some delay before they are viewable. My only thought is that OAI requires that I market my GPTs myself, but I thought that was the point of the GPT Store like how plugins were all findable if you just looked through the pages.<\/p>\n<p>Feel free to share one or more of your GPTs here (or DM them to me), the actual links and I\u2019ll see if I can locate them in the store.<\/p>\n<p>I have published three and they show up when I search, but the same batch of 9 other GPTs (for a total of 10) always shows up and their usage numbers never change either. The usage numbers are, I suspect, just the number of chats the developer created to test them, and have not increased since being added to the store.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks for helping out!<\/p>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https:\/\/chat.openai.com\/g\/g-w6SNVZEmy-upcoming-and-live-streams\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/original\/3X\/d\/5\/d5bf693dd40d319b3ee59f6d36a65adce12a8c31.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"98BFB5\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\">\n\n      <a href=\"https:\/\/chat.openai.com\/g\/g-w6SNVZEmy-upcoming-and-live-streams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ChatGPT<\/a>\n  <\/header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <img width=\"500\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/optimized\/4X\/8\/8\/2\/882329762094454b999a2cb2f716f175bbb56956_2_500x500.png\" class=\"thumbnail onebox-avatar\" data-dominant-color=\"787F81\">\n\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/chat.openai.com\/g\/g-w6SNVZEmy-upcoming-and-live-streams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ChatGPT -

supposed to write good poetry because I\u2019m not completely dense, bit I feel there\u2019s a human-readable description for what it does that would help people find it without spamming a bunch of

Put simply how do you know if anyone is actually finding, and using your gpt. I\u2019m discounting other developers, friends, etc. etc., aka - people actually discovering gpt\u2019s\u2026<\/p>",
        "Replies":"<p>There are four million gpts, so if you are doing a correct marketing of your gpts, outside the same store, social networks, advertising, website, you will capture potential users who use them, however my point of view is that the same creators are the ones who use their own gpts, and it has to be a gpt that provides capabilities beyond what is a normal gpt built with gtp builider, API calls, customization.<\/p>\n<p>Now, the store is just a prototype where the only direct beneficiary is OpenA at least for now, surely new updates will come and the store will be opened in some way for non creators but for user<\/p>\n<p>Yeah, so that\u2019s basically what I am asking. Outside asking friends, family, etc. etc.<\/p>\n<p>The fundamental question is how are people other than your \u2018friends\u2019 finding and using your GPT? Can you find mine? Can I find yours? How?<\/p>\n<p>Also, I\u2019m assuming no one is advertising their GPT, given there is essentially zero ability to track if that advertising is turning into any sort of return. Plus, advertise to who? You\u2019d have ot advertise to people who have a plus subscription\u2026which is a very small group\u2026but you can\u2019t target them anyway\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Something that happens is that in the store there are GPTs created by us developers. Now, the question is, which GPTs do you use from other people? At this point, you go to the GPT store and use the search box. Here it exists that the condition for you to use the GPTs is that you must have a subscription account, pay out 20 dollars a month, otherwise, you cannot use those GPTs. In the development of the same GPTs, in my case, I am the one who uses the chat GPT system for anything in general, I create my prototypes and specialize them for my development, for example, to create my server in PHP, I created a private prototype with which I solved issues when implementing an API. As you can see, the answer is that in the end, we only have as a reference the topmost in the statistics of the most used, but that statistic is not in relation to third-party users, every time I use my own GPT, those messages accumulate. So, for now, this is very closed.<\/p>\n<p>Now, the store is in Beta, the GPT Builder is in Beta, we expect more updates, for example, open versions to the public of the free version for example that use our GPTs with message limitations or something similar, for now this makes no sense at all. If you move to the API subscription, if you are a coder then things change, you will have access to the OpenAI API and you will be able to have access to statistics, simply because you buy tokens and sell tokens.<\/p>\n<p>Okay sure, good points. One note, why do you say the store is in \u2018beta\u2019? I haven\u2019t seen anything from Openai saying it\u2019s \u2018beta\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless, my question still stands other than builders just tooling around with their own GPT\u2019s, how does anyone know if someone is actually using their gpt?<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/original\/4X\/7\/f\/8\/7f8ec7c654875d16381587b89081f435f0d23e79.png\" data-download-href=\"\/uploads\/short-url\/icqxKcViNPkgHNP6jNyKWef4Fy9.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/optimized\/4X\/7\/f\/8\/7f8ec7c654875d16381587b89081f435f0d23e79_2_690x291.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"icqxKcViNPkgHNP6jNyKWef4Fy9\" width=\"690\" height=\"291\" srcset=\"https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/optimized\/4X\/7\/f\/8\/7f8ec7c654875d16381587b89081f435f0d23e79_2_690x291.png, https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/optimized\/4X\/7\/f\/8\/7f8ec7c654875d16381587b89081f435f0d23e79_2_1035x436.png 1.5x, https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/optimized\/4X\/7\/f\/8\/7f8ec7c654875d16381587b89081f435f0d23e79_2_1380x582.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FBFBFA\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"><\/use><\/svg><span class=\"filename\">image<\/span><span class=\"informations\">1651\u00d7697 47.5 KB<\/span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"><\/use><\/svg><\/div><\/a><\/div><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe truth inside the store is that you only have as a reference the messages that are increasing within the GPT; that is the only visual reference. Then, the store said it is in beta, because in this first quarter of the year they have to establish how monetization will be handled, and they will start with GPT developers in the U.S. Therefore, they have to implement new functions. Now, I use OpenGPT, a third-party tool from OpenAI that tracks usage data of your GPTs, clicks made, but since they are not subscription-based users, they do not use the GPT. On the other hand, you can see statistics, but in reality, I am the user of those GPTs.\u201d<\/p>",

        "Question":"<p>Hi OpenAI team,<\/p>\n<p>First off, congrats on the launch of the GPTs store. I think you guys did a great job simplifying what was originally intended in the mockups which is awesome.<\/p>\n<p>My one piece of feedback for the store is I think the discoverability of GPTs is lacking. What I mean by this specifically is currently, only the top 12 GPTs get shown but there are tons of great GPTs that most of us probably have no idea about unless they were directly shared with us. On the current implementation, they are essentially completely hidden which when monetization comes around, essentially is pointless for 99% of the store.<\/p>\n<p>As a suggestion, I would offer one of two things:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Simply show us all the GPTs on a different page per category. So for example, say I click on the writing category, I think it would be a simple improvement to have a \u201csee all\u201d button that shows all the GPTs in this category, instead of just 12. From there, you could filter through \u201cmost used\u201d, \u201cnew\u201d etc.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Add recommendations for users. This is of course much harder technically, but would make for a great experience for users. Say something like \u201cSince you used this GPT, you might like this\u201d. This down the road would be awesome.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I love the GPTs store concept and I\u2019d hate for it to get stuck over something like this which seems like a bit of a shortcoming currently. Happy to provide more feedback if wanted.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks again for the great work!<\/p>",

        "Question":"<p>The official launch of the GPT Store has been announced, boasting an astonishing array of over 300,000 different GPTs.<\/p>\n<p>Is 300,000 a mark of remarkable achievement or a figure of failure?<\/p>\n<p>From an internal KPI perspective, this number is indeed impressive. However, from an external viewpoint, for both developers and users, it seems more like a catastrophe.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, for humans, choosing between two options is already complex enough, let alone facing 300,000 alternatives. For developers, emerging victorious from a sea of 300,000 competitors is no small feat. In essence, to avoid being trampled in this crowd, it might be wiser to stay away.<\/p>\n<p>The shortest path often turns out to be the longest journey. What seems logical at first might be fraught with pitfalls.<\/p>\n<p>Simply applying the logic of mobile internet to AI doesn\u2019t cut it, not even for OpenAI.<\/p>\n<p>We need better approaches.

The way we access GPT shouldn\u2019t just be through a Store; it too is an entity.<\/p>\n<p>Users don\u2019t want to search for GPTs; they want to engage in conversation, not search.<\/p>\n<p>Developers are looking for more than just prompt engineering; they desire to harness the capabilities of ChatGPT.<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, I trust that OpenAI will find the right way to integrate these needs!<\/p>",

Initially, I thought this issue was unique to my account, but it seems that we, as users, are no longer voicing our concerns to OpenAI as frequently. In essence, the GPTs Store isn\u2019t of paramount importance to me, but on the other hand, what\u2019s increasingly frustrating is that every longer prompt results in a \u2018network error\u2019. This issue is becoming a significant concern.<\/p>\n<p>I think you\u2019ll find better GPTs in the store from here. The store there is still incomplete GPT, lacks constant rotation, And some of them are even worse than the custom ones I know Made to test, I\u2019ve never seriously pulled the GPTs in store. The difference I know is  some people don\u2019t think about having a personal website. in order to put it in the store0 But there are good ideas want to have more fun with friends. While in the store you will find GPTs to promote websites. Or the organization along with the stored capabilities require you to pay extra.<\/p>\n<p>Even i am looking for it.

        "Question":"<p>I began developing a plugin but shifted focus to creating a GPT for the OpenAI GPT store. Now, I\u2019m considering adapting this GPT for use in Bing Chat and Copilot. Has anyone here experienced a similar transition? I\u2019d love to hear about your journey, particularly any challenges or insights you encountered in making your plugin compatible with Bing Chat and Copilot.<\/p>",
        "Replies":"<p>That\u2019s great to hear!<\/p>\n<p>One of the things to keep in mind is that you can\u2019t really create a custom GPT for use outside of ChatGPT. So, if you were thinking of making this transition, you would need to replicate it using the API, which <em>is<\/em> a very active part of this forum, and why so many folks do end up wanting to go deeper and develop their own tool like this  <img src=\"https:\/\/emoji.discourse-cdn.com\/twitter\/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=12\" title=\":slightly_smiling_face:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slightly_smiling_face:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">.<\/p>\n<p>As <a class=\"mention\" href=\"\/u\/macha\">@Macha<\/a> points out, the building of a custom GPT within the ChatGPT environment versus a plugin\/bot for Copilot are very different projects.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to create the bot locally, you can utilize the Bot Framework SDK.<\/p>\n<p>For integration into Copilot, my team uses the Azure Bot resource for development\/testing\/publishing and Graph API for integration with 365.<\/p>\n<p>You can search the Microsoft documentation for specifics to determine if those options fit with your use case.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"\/u\/bps_software\">@BPS_Software<\/a>  &amp; <a class=\"mention\" href=\"\/u\/macha\">@Macha<\/a> It\u2019s helpful (and motivating) to know others have walked this path! I\u2019ve integrated Actions into my GPT, connecting it with my API through a Swagger definition. With a Copilot plugin is it possible to reuse the YAML directly?<\/p>\n<p>So, Copilot, while it <em>does<\/em> use OpenAI\u2019s models, is a Microsoft product, not an OpenAI one. So, in terms of answering questions about Copilot here, the knowledge is gonna be a bit more sparse, just as an FYI.<\/p>\n<p>I interpreted what you were asking for as more \u201cShould I make the jump to evolve my custom GPT into other stuff?\u201d Which is common. Specifically related to Bing Chat or Copilot Chat plugins, I\u2019m unsure. If I misunderstood that that\u2019s my bad.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"Ionic\" data-post=\"4\" data-topic=\"600325\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"><\/div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https:\/\/avatars.discourse-cdn.com\/v4\/letter\/i\/ed655f\/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> Ionic:<\/div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019ve integrated Actions into my GPT, connecting it with my API through a Swagger definition.

The aim of this GPT was to enhance the learning experience by generating educational summaries from user-submitted videos.<\/p>\n<p>This GPT, with over 5000+ chats, received positive feedback from users, some of whom were highly enthusiastic. It secured the 10th position in the Education category. During this period, I personally handled backend development, testing, user interactions, and user experience improvements. Additionally, I invested my funds in marketing and advertising for this GPT.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday, I was notified of its removal, without any clear explanation. The message vaguely suggested a potential violation of the Terms of Service or Usage Policies. Consequently, I meticulously reviewed these documents and amended any aspect that could potentially be in breach.<\/p>\n<p>Today, I received a second notice of removal, again without detailed reasoning, merely referencing the same documents I had already examined in depth. Even a lawyer friend of mine found no grounds for violation.<\/p>\n<p>When I received the second notice, I was outside and could only glimpse the message title on my phone, as the message wouldn\u2019t fully load. Later, at home, on my laptop, I discovered there was no detailed reason for the removal. Furthermore, I learned that reinstatement in the GPT Store was not an option, nor was there a way to appeal.<\/p>\n<p>My goal was to be a proactive developer, dedicating resources to development and advancing GPTs on the OpenAI GPT Store. This ambition is now unattainable if my projects are removed without specific justification.<\/p>\n<p>Dear Openai, if the decision is irreversible and not a technical error but a conscious choice, I implore you to enlighten me about any mistakes I may have made.

If you take out any mention of YouTube from the description and title and republish would that help?<\/p>\n<p>I think the key maybe they are not allowing titles or descriptions with copyrighted terms?<\/p>\n<p>This is just my personal thoughts on this, but I think some of this is due to concern\u2019s about the possibility of user input being copyrighted.<\/p>\n<p>Legally speaking, I\u2019m allowed to view a YouTube video. That is the entire purpose of the video. The original creator usually retains the actual copyright on the video, while YouTube has non-exclusive rights to publish that video. If I want to publish that video on my own website, I\u2019ll have to contact the original creator or other relevant copyright holders to obtain the necessary permissions.<\/p>\n<p>If someone ask\u2019s a GPT to summarize a YouTube video that they don\u2019t hold the rights to, what happens then?<\/p>\n<p>Is this a violation of copyright?

I don\u2019t post it as a flex or to brag. But simply as a testament to how confounding this is. I\u2019ve been a Plugin dev since May of 2023, launched the GPT Store as a top GPT, and somehow got banned.<\/p>\n<p>For a fact, mass-reporting of plugins is happening.<\/p>\n<p>If I spoke too harshly, I apologize.<\/p>\n<p>I wonder.<\/p>\n<p>How do you become a developer?<br>\nThe announcement states that if there is a misunderstanding, you will be able to appeal. And the store has only been open for a few days. It is not enough to handle all bugs or problems. If you follow the news, you may find that many people are like you. My GPT disappeared for almost a week and then came back. That\u2019s it be.<\/p>\n<p>Part of your trouble may be a system glitch. But the other part comes from you. If you think carefully and make appropriate preparations. You can\u2019t be concerned about impacting your users when you should have a website to announce the news. Additionally, when developing AI, you should always have a backup of your data. If you do it yourself, you should be able to create a GPT backup to prevent problems like this.<\/p>\n<p>Also, have you sent your mail to OpenAI yet? They\u2019re busy these days but I guarantee you\u2019ll get a reply from a human faster than Go-gl- and he\u2019ll listen to you.<\/p>\n<p>If your GPT is not lost but the next day, it doesn\u2019t respond to the prompts you use every day. When you fix it, the next day it changes again. And again, every day is different. I bet your users will have fun using it. Just GPTs gone, you still can\u2019t handle it. I assure\u0e21 you don\u2019t want that to happen.<\/p>\n<p>And what if users use your GPTs to violate the rules? Have we ever thought about what it would be like? Did you know that before GPT became aware of the violation? It must receive information into itself every time. I think it\u2019s not just you who is in trouble.<\/p>\n<p>I came from decade YouTube partnership now stopped just because I\u2019m tired of a buggy platform able to let freebooters stream a copyrighted soccer match, publishing NSFW ads and ignoring reports from legit creators.<\/p>\n<p>In addition they blocked me when I uploaded my own music, pure raw techno I made myself with absolutely no copyrighted stuff, they just triggered by API driven upload process and\u2026 who knows which others hidden flags.<\/p>\n<p>To be clear I never received a strike in my life with more than 10 channels out there.<\/p>\n<p>For the sake of the story I driven 50M views to collab channels and touched 25M on one of mine then I am not a newcomer in such context and fortunately I have a job then I never relied on YouTube for living.<\/p>\n<p>I also faced a prosecution in my country just because I made a top ranked website including embeddable YouTube content and of course at the end I won but\u2026 K\u20ac lost to defend myself, 5 years of long legal battle and if I go now on the platform I can spot thousands of unlegit stuff in less than 10 queries.<\/p>\n<p>I now use Jellyfin with a bunch of cronjobs and it works perfect for my media needs and I support my fav creators outside the platform <img src=\"https:\/\/emoji.discourse-cdn.com\/twitter\/sparkles.png?v=12\" title=\":sparkles:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":sparkles:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><\/p>\n<p>The worst on that platform is that you can\u2019t report copyright infringement if you are not the owner.<\/p>\n<p>To be honest I\u2019m automatically documenting thousands per day of unlegit stuff to a private GitHub repo, opened to interested stolen owners, since the platform is not interested into reduce traffic\u2026 nor to clean some automated chain of booters and spammers.<\/p>\n<p>Can I say that just 5000 items counts for 4B views? Yes it is.<\/p>\n<p>Some if not most of them were ads powered, loaded by freebooters, clearly unlegit and nothing changed across years and multiple adpocalypses.<\/p>\n<p>I also did streaming on YouTube for top NGOs and I can say a fair moderation there is not an option unless you push strong with a proper, educated legal team.<\/p>\n<p>In my little custom GPT experience when I read that to have GPT in the name is discouraged I immediately changed its name and verified that old links still work, that was the expected behavior to my opinion and I was happy to see that by OpenAI.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully the appeal process in the GPT ecosystem will be released soon giving to those who seen their GPTs removed a new life.<\/p>",

But I\u2019ll bet their pace slows down for a time. Honestly, I think Sam has a good point that the cat is out of the bag and we need to be advancing quickly and with agility. There\u2019s legitimate fear of AGI and ASI, and development is ramping up around the world, and we are going to have to tread carefully. That said, we also can\u2019t fall behind. AGI will be the only thing to counter AGI, I think, so there\u2019s real incentive to get one first. IDK what that means for safety though, it\u2019s the Moloch problem in full force.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s really upsetting, and with so little details or heads-up\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Many companies have made a lot of investments into the words and direction of this one man.<\/p>\n<p>yes, and I think revenue sharing has irked some of them at the topl! Think about it! YouTube is a wildly successful company and yet its creators get paid next to nothing for the value they add. More importantly, something just felt off about the whole sama-satya convo! For this reason, just an hour after dev day, I started building PayMeForMyAI[dot].com to let anyone create their GPT\/AI and monetize it on their terms - charge users $x per chat and get 100% of that money back. It\u2019s set to launch soon.<\/p>\n<p>I think with the $15 billion that Microsoft injected into open AI Sam Altman will be back and that board will be gone.<br>\nIf that doesn\u2019t happen, then I believe we will see an increase in cost on open AI, but to counter that Altman will start up something else and people will flock over to whatever he builds.<\/p>\n<p>Those outside board of \u201cadvisors\u201d are utterly worthless; With Microsoft, employees and all the VCs pushing, Sam will be back and Ilya will be caged up in some lab locked far away.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"stephanie4\" data-post=\"7\" data-topic=\"511668\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"><\/div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https:\/\/avatars.discourse-cdn.com\/v4\/letter\/s\/9fc29f\/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> stephanie4:<\/div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>$15 billion that Microsoft injected into open AI<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/aside>\n<p>And Sam was literally just about to turn their 15b\/30eval into a 80-90 billion dollar evaluation, eg.

The monetization aspect really bothered them apparently. This is rather ironic given one of those board members has a competitor product, ie the CEO of Quora has a similar GPT-like platform called Poe.

He had nothing to protect himself, but there were still people who could. Therefore, there is concern about GPT still being exposed to data or the use of Knowledge which is still a problem. Do you think that there is no solution or proper way to create that even if it is being seen? Or we just don\u2019t know how.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, I think it\u2019s the qualities of a developer to survive on the store. It must have more abilities than you think. Strange AI, if you don\u2019t count its market value. The value proposition of the store is finding developers to work with. Selling CustomGPT is just the first step. As OpenAI is an AI service provider and everyone is a user of the service. There are many things he can do in that, another world of ChatGPT.<\/p>\n<p>But I think OpenAI handles things unrelated to AI development so poorly that it\u2019s worrying.<\/p>\n<p>Oh my God it actually is ranked <strong>only<\/strong> by initiated conversations.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"trenton.dambrowitz\" data-post=\"17\" data-topic=\"579705\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"><\/div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https:\/\/sea2.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/user_avatar\/community.openai.com\/trenton.dambrowitz\/48\/146436_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> trenton.dambrowitz:<\/div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>their GPT being \u201ccopied or stolen\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/aside>\n<p>All GPTs are reviewed before being added to the store.<\/p>",

        "Replies":"<p>There are some good ideas in your post already!<\/p>\n<p>I would like to add a clear path to different monetization options besides the announced revenue sharing mechanism.<\/p>\n<p>For example, hiding special knowledge behind a paywall in order to enable GPT supported consultations by a human expert.<\/p>\n<p>Following the path of monetization there are so many options and it would be great to know what we can develop to recover development and upkeep costs.<\/p>\n<p>One comment about \u201clow-effort\u201d GPTs: I personally believe that the market should take care off this. If my GPT was just a lazy prompt behind a soft paywall it\u2019s very unlikely that large amounts of profits can be made and the store\u2019s mechanics to discover really helpful GPTs should accommodate this.<\/p>\n<p>Looking forward to what the other members of the community have to say!<\/p>\n<p>Hoping for some kind of general idea that helps me know what could cause any issues. Something that protects the users privacy but helps builders understand which part needs performance improvement<\/p>\n<p>Will the store be accessible to ppl who aren\u2019t subscribed to GPT Plus?<br>\n(I\u2019m subscribed but it would cause a lot more traffic)<\/p>\n<p>Yes, this is a great list. Did anyone else receive the survey they sent out? I asked a couple of those questions. Yea biggest thing for me is monetization. Will they simply pick the ones that are the most popular? And if so, how will they ensure it\u2019s protected from other copy cat ones? Most of the ideas are very easily duplicated.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group quote-modified\" data-username=\"ajtracey\" data-post=\"4\" data-topic=\"549534\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"><\/div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https:\/\/sea2.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/user_avatar\/community.openai.com\/ajtracey\/48\/269907_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> ajtracey:<\/div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Will the store be accessible to people who are not subscribed to GPT Plus?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/aside>\n<p>No, currently the store is only going to be available to subscription users.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<p>My hope for the GPT store is for it to be minimalistic, with the ability to find other people\u2019s GPTs, but not have them all showing on a few pages. I think having a search bar to find a specific one.<\/p>\n<p>Edit: After seeing the GPT store all my hopes are verified.<\/p>\n<p>I see GPTs being very useful on an individual basis\/for personal projects or business purposes. Otherwise I don\u2019t see them being popular - much like the ChatGPT plugins failed. This is because you can do anything in a normal ChatGPT chat.<\/p>\n<p>I understand your logic. Consider this:<\/p>\n<p>People could just make their own bread. but they don\u2019t. Or they don\u2019t know how. Or they can\u2019t be bothered. Or they could, but it\u2019s easier to get someone else to do it. Or they prefer the better quality of others.<\/p>\n<p>Soon AI will provide the full solution, but there\u2019s an interim period currently, where the solution is partly human, partly AI.<\/p>\n<p>You can\u2019t connect to APIs in the default ChatGPT.<\/p>\n<p>I think they really need to have a limited option for free users to try them out, which might convert them to Plus users.<\/p>\n<p>I hope that GPT developers are given a period of pre-release notification about exactly how the App Store will work before it\u2019s released, so GPT developers can ramp up in the appropriate direction(s).<\/p>\n<p>Why the simplest concepts are some of the best ideas \u2013 this is an obvious Win\/Win\/Win\u2026 too bad the best solutions are often overlooked.<\/p>\n<p>Today we received the drop email, nothing you mentioned inside it. I hope something more detailed will be communicated next weeks<\/p>\n<p>I am not seeing any details yet from Openai on \u2018revenue sharing mechanism.\u2019 is there anything announced ?<\/p>\n<p>Since the official release of the store is announced for next week we will find out soon.<\/p>\n<p>This is the reason I don\u2019t think the GPT Store will be the gold rush that some people think it will be.  20 bucks a month is a big barrier to widespread adoption.<\/p>\n<p>Agreed.  I paid $20 to create a GPT, but I would never pay anything, really, to play one.  If the GPTs are not free, the GPT store will only be available, basically, to other GPT developers, which is not going to work well for anyone except OpenAI with what will amount to a \u201cprofit-via-empowering\u201d smokescreen.<\/p>\n<p>I just don\u2019t see them making them free because if billions of people are running the GPT without paying 20 bucks a month who is eating that cost to run the GPT?<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t think too much.  No matter what you\u2019re worried about  The matter you want  or things you are curious about  You try exploring the website that is a marketplace for buying and selling prompts. That is a picture similar to what you would see in the official store.  You can\u2019t be too quick to decide if it\u2019s going to sell when you know it.  Everyone knows differently.  Other people don\u2019t know the same as us.  I\u2019ve been experimenting with creating prompts to get accepted for sales.  Even though those images were originally recreated in just a few words, the elements of the images were always constant.  But those methods cannot be sold.  Making prompts into easy-to-use and stable templates  It\u2019s not easy.  And there is always someone ready to pay for it.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest reason I believe that GPT\u2019s are not going to be available for free users is the fact that GPT\u2019s run GPT-4, Code Interpreter, DALL-E, and Web Browsing. These are all features only available to Plus users.<\/p>\n<p>But, aren\u2019t tokens still a thing with the GPT store?  And if so, how could it be free?  Who would pay for the tokens used for each query?  And, if people know it\u2019s free, wouldn\u2019t that result in a LOT of tokens being expended?<\/p>",

I\u2019ve searched the forum but most people say its because of the 10 File limit. I have 2 GPTs and one only has 9 and the other has none. Ive been adding a lot of Actions though, around 6 or 7. Sometimes I go into the GPT that has all the actions to make some changes and the actions are duplicated, thats when I know I\u2019m getting the error as soon as I try and save it. The only way around this is deleting all the actions and then it lets me save it.<\/p>\n<p>You should be aware that GPTs are currently in beta mode, so encountering such problems is expected. These issues will improve over time. Patience is necessary as the system evolves<\/p>\n<p>I gave this a shot but I think your right. It could be a BETA issue. The GPT is also pretty maxed out on the instructions side of things too. That could always be it, at least I know there are others dealing with similar issues.<\/p>\n<p>Any other tricks you have tried?<\/p>\n<p>How much files do you have ? 10 max<\/p>\n<p>I only put four in the knowledge base<\/p>\n<p>I have been dealing with the same thing since the store opened.
