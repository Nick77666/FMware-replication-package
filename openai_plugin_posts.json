Have you checked with OpenAI whether they support the freemium model where a certain amount of Plugin usage is free and further usage is paid?<\/p>\n<p>I would love to try Plugin Lab for monetization but I want to be sure my Plugins don\u2019t violate OpenAI policies.<\/p>\n<p>Best<br>\nChris<\/p>\n<p>Well, at the moment, the plugin policies stand the following:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/platform.openai.com\/docs\/plugins\/production\/can-i-charge-people-money-for-my-plugin\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https:\/\/platform.openai.com\/docs\/plugins\/production\/can-i-charge-people-money-for-my-plugin<\/a><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Can I charge people money for my plugin?<br>\nNot at this time.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>However, it has been explained here in the forum that OpenAI mainly wanted to discourage people of having a Paywall during plugin installation.<\/p>\n<p>This would result in a bad user experience for sure.<\/p>\n<p>But on the other hand, you have plugins like Zapier that are completely free but Zapier itself is a freemium and monetizes their platform.<\/p>\n<p>So to us, there\u2019s such a small nuance between making people pay for the plugin itself, which is forbidden, and making people pay externally for your service, which is not forbidden if we take the case of Zapier, for example.<\/p>\n<p>At PluginLab, what we do is we only protect your main API with Quotas. So in that sense, people don\u2019t pay for your Plugin. They pay for unlocking new limits in your external service.<\/p>\n<p>The thing is we integrate that directly by sending a link in ChatGPT so the user experience is optimal.<\/p>\n<p>To be honest we didn\u2019t catchup with OpenAI on this subject, but I would love to get some thoughts from <a class=\"mention\" href=\"\/u\/logankilpatrick\">@logankilpatrick<\/a> about this. <img src=\"https:\/\/emoji.discourse-cdn.com\/twitter\/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><\/p>\n<p>Thank you for the summary, Kevin!<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"\/u\/logankilpatrick\">@logankilpatrick<\/a> Would be really helpful to get clarification from you guys on this. It makes sense that Plugins shouldn\u2019t be behind a paywall but on the other hand smaller startups can\u2019t afford to run servers entirely for free - so paid over a certain quota is the perfect balance IMO.<\/p>\n<p>Plug-ins that require registration or payments should likely have their own category, such that they can be excluded from a search.<\/p>\n<p>Agree that would make sense. It could have a category such as \u201cIn App payments\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Did anyone get clarification from OpenAI on this? I am wondering the same thing - my plugins are free of charge for limited usage, and folks are asking for more. And I am not sure where the policy stands.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"onebox twitterstatus\" data-onebox-src=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/adam_janis\/status\/1674404529679355906\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/adam_janis\/status\/1674404529679355906\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">twitter.com<\/a>\n  <\/header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <img src=\"https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/original\/3X\/2\/d\/2db3ffdda418aa4e0dddf45bf804bd45d04ef608.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail onebox-avatar\" data-dominant-color=\"474F3B\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\">\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/adam_janis\/status\/1674404529679355906\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Adam Jani\u0161<\/a><\/h4>\n<div class=\"twitter-screen-name\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/adam_janis\/status\/1674404529679355906\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">@adam_janis<\/a><\/div>\n\n<div class=\"tweet\">\n  <span class=\"tweet-description\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/OfficialLoganK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">@OfficialLoganK<\/a> there is no native <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/OpenAI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">@OpenAI<\/a> ChatGPT \u201cpay for plugin\u201d option, but are plugins allowed to send payment links to offer services on top of the rate-limited free allowance?

Partnered plugins like Zapier have no problem providing a \u201cfree\u201d plugin while providing a paid service in the end. So this logic should apply to everyone and I am quite confident about that.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>but I do know who controls the Plugin marketplace, and they decide how they wish things to go within the ecosystem.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The sad reality is many plugin creators are bleeding with server costs. As a user, I prefer using a paid plugin for someone who put their heart into crafting something amazing than not paying and seeing my favorite plugin shut down because their creator was not able to pay the bills.<\/p>\n<p>I know right especially since when you click on a paid plugin, and try to back out you have to hopefully remember where you where or search again since it starts you off at the beginning of the list when you come, back. Or dont make the paid versions so automatic that you can\u2019t cancel. Anyways maybe that was just my experience.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The sad reality is many plugin creators are bleeding with server costs. As a user, I prefer using a paid plugin for someone who put their heart into crafting something amazing than not paying and seeing my favorite plugin shut down because their creator was not able to pay the bills.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>If it\u2019s a passion project I am agreeing strongly here, it would be nice to have this separated from commercial plug-ins though. Not making loss\/ensuring existence is a very different goal from profit maximization.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s presumably called a \u201cstore\u201d for a reason.<\/p>\n<p>As mentioned, Zapier\u2019s plugin is freemium.  But it seems Zapier gets preferential treatment, being a YC company.  They seem to have functionality allowed that no other plugin developer can mimic.  So is an open question if Zapier is allowed to \u201ccharge\u201d for their service while other plugin developers will be denied.<\/p>\n<p>Another question in my mind is if OpenAI will start charging plugin developers a percentage of sales, like the Apple app store\u2026<\/p>\n<p>openai itself is primarily a non-profit, with a limited profit part. I am not in favor of a ban of commercial plug-ins if openai is taking a good cut of the profit or sales, then it likely will have a positive impact.<\/p>\n<p>I would simply like a sorting function just like in the app-store and also information about the plug-in developer, such that GDPR etc. can be properly enforced.<\/p>\n<p>did anyone find out of this is acceptable. <a class=\"mention\" href=\"\/u\/kevinpiac\">@kevinpiac<\/a> did you get any word from openai if we\u2019re good charging for usage? I\u2019d like to give a quota and then charge for usage beyond that.<\/p>\n<p>OpenAI never officially answered this.<\/p>\n<p>I guess it\u2019s a matter of legal issues that would come with the fact of officially authorizing people to do it.<\/p>\n<p>They would have to manage support, terms, and many things at scale for something that is still in beta and realistically not their priority.<\/p>\n<p>What I can tell is PluginLab is in touch with their team, and they are aware that plugins such as KeyMate AI achieved $35K in MRR using <a href=\"https:\/\/pluginlab.ai\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">PluginLab<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>ChatOCR also publicly communicated they achieved $2K in MRR using <a href=\"https:\/\/pluginlab.ai\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">PluginLab<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Many more plugins are monetizing but not saying it publicly.<\/p>\n<p>So the decision is up to you.<\/p>\n<p>If you decide to do it, feel free to ping me when you register to PluginLab and I will be happy to give you useful pieces of advice <img src=\"https:\/\/emoji.discourse-cdn.com\/twitter\/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><\/p>",

So, it\u2019s likely just a mistake in the UI that will hopefully be fixed.<\/p>\n<p>I had my TTL set to half an hour, but it verified in a couple minutes. I had to refresh to get it in the dropdown list to assign it, though. Good luck!<\/p>\n<p>Same here. Is there a solution right now? Or do I need a domain?<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ll ask around. I\u2019ve heard of a few people not having name available, but I\u2019m not sure 100% why yet\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Thanks for reply. Yesterday ChatGPT was down. So it took around 40 mins for me.<\/p>\n<p>Using your domain name can be beneficial for your personal branding.<\/p>\n<p>Yep, on the same boat. Please update if you solved this issue.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m the same. I can\u2019t work out how to deal with the text file check onto my domain that OpenAI seems to require as a verification. Thought this was the whole point of building gpts without coding experience lol<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve now asked gpt for detailed instructions on what to do with the text file and have access by following the details.<br>\nFull details are -<\/p>\n<p>To set up your builder profile to publish GPTs publicly, especially focusing on what to do with your domain and the TXT file provided by OpenAI, follow these detailed steps:<\/p>\n<pre><code>1.\tCreate an OpenAI Account: If you haven\u2019t done so already, sign up for an account with OpenAI. This will give you access to the necessary tools and resources.\n2.\tAccess Builder Dashboard: Once you have an OpenAI account, log in and navigate to the \u2018Builder\u2019 dashboard. This is where you can manage your GPT applications.\n3.\tCreate a New Project: Start a new project for your GPT application. You\u2019ll be prompted to enter basic information about your project, like its name and description.\n4.\tConfigure Domain Settings:\n\u2022\tTo publish your GPTs publicly, you\u2019ll need to have a domain name. If you don\u2019t have one, purchase a domain from a registrar like GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.\n\u2022\tOnce you have your domain, you need to verify ownership with OpenAI. This is where the TXT file comes in.\n5.\tVerify Domain Ownership:\n\u2022\tOpenAI will provide you with a TXT record. This is a type of DNS (Domain Name System) record used to prove domain ownership.\n\u2022\tLog in to your domain registrar\u2019s control panel and navigate to the DNS settings section.\n\u2022\tAdd a new TXT record, pasting the value provided by OpenAI. The exact steps for this may vary depending on your domain registrar, but generally, you\u2019ll need to specify the TXT record type, enter \u2018@\u2019 in the host field (or your domain), and paste the value from OpenAI in the value field.\n\u2022\tSave your changes. It may take some time (up to 48 hours, usually less) for DNS changes to propagate.\n6.\tWait for Verification: After adding the TXT record, return to the OpenAI Builder dashboard and confirm that you\u2019ve added the record. OpenAI will then verify your domain, which may take a short while.\n7.\tPublish Your GPTs:\n\u2022\tOnce your domain is verified, you can proceed to publish your GPT applications.\n\u2022\tUse the Builder tools to configure and customize your GPT model as per your requirements.\n\u2022\tAfter setting it up, you can publish your GPT application. It will now be accessible publicly through your domain.\n8.\tMonitor and Update: Keep an eye on your GPT application for usage, performance, and feedback. Regularly update and maintain your application to ensure it functions smoothly.\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Would you like more information on any specific step, or is there another way I can assist you?<\/p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"blocksadhu\" data-post=\"7\" data-topic=\"483870\" data-full=\"true\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"><\/div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https:\/\/sea2.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/user_avatar\/community.openai.com\/blocksadhu\/48\/146474_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> blocksadhu:<\/div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hi can you tell how much time it took for your domain verification?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/aside>\n<p>A second, in my case.<\/p>\n<p>But GPT has errors or something, so it did verify in a second and than told me I had to verify it\u2026<\/p>\n<p>After hitting \u201cverify it!!!\u201d I closed the browser, waited 5 minutes and than my domain showed up as \u201cverified\u201d.<\/p>",

        "Question":"<p>Hey everyone,<\/p>\n<p>Like many of you, I\u2019ve been deep in the trenches of ChatGPT plugin development, and the question of monetization has been on my mind a lot lately. I think We all know about the amazing solution for monetization and authentication from PluginLab, especially for those leaning into subscriptions. But for those of us with free plugins, it\u2019s a different story.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve had some success with affiliate links in my plugins, and it\u2019s been a decent way to bring in a bit of income without setting up barriers. But I\u2019ve been wondering: What other methods are out there? I\u2019ve seen some plugins experimenting with traffic exchanges, and it\u2019s got me thinking.<\/p>\n<p>Actually, I\u2019ve been toying with the idea of creating a solution or service specifically geared towards helping with ChatGPT plugin monetization. I\u2019m still in the early stages, and I haven\u2019t built anything concrete yet. But I\u2019m genuinely interested in understanding what we, as developers, really need.<\/p>\n<p>So, if you\u2019ve got some insights, experiences, or even pain points you\u2019d like to share, I\u2019d love to chat. Whether it\u2019s about what\u2019s worked for you, what hasn\u2019t, or what you wish existed in the monetization space, let\u2019s have a conversation. Your input could help shape something that benefits all of us.<\/p>\n<p>Drop a comment below or reach out directly. Looking forward to some enlightening discussions!<\/p>\n<p>Cheers.<\/p>",

I asked ChatGPT to interpret the question. See the answer below. I believe the point 4 (Technical Feasibility) is the reason why the monetization is \u201cNot at this time.\u201d OpenAI does not have an Apple Store or Google Play style platform yet. That question does warrant a clarification from OpenAI.<\/p>\n<p>Here is one of my use cases. The plugin is an early crisis warning system that predicts the probability of future crises like the 2008 financial meltdown and COVID. Keep in mind both disasters had early clear signs on the Internet. A lot of resources (google-sized) will be required to crawl the Internet in order to support the functionality of the plugin. It would be reasonable to have Terms of Use that requires institutional users to pay for the service, even if the plugin is technically accessible (free) to everyone.<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t see why OpenAI, such a benevolent company whose mission is to serve the entire humanity, would go out of their ways to forbid the monetization of the service.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/original\/3X\/0\/4\/04a2ef5e2a9af527ccbfe92582db09f97bee6327.png\" data-download-href=\"\/uploads\/short-url\/F0ZMPHRt22n3Hmoe6LdEPNapZt.png?dl=1\" title=\"M\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/original\/3X\/0\/4\/04a2ef5e2a9af527ccbfe92582db09f97bee6327.png\" alt=\"M\" data-base62-sha1=\"F0ZMPHRt22n3Hmoe6LdEPNapZt\" width=\"452\" height=\"500\" data-dominant-color=\"EFEFF1\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"><\/use><\/svg><span class=\"filename\">M<\/span><span class=\"informations\">827\u00d7913 47.1 KB<\/span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"><\/use><\/svg><\/div><\/a><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Let me preface this by saying I don\u2019t work for OpenAI, so my opinions are my own.<\/p>\n<p>If you wish to make money from a model OpenAI has created, should you also need to contribute to it\u2019s training? This is an honest question. Yes you have spent time creating a plugin, and that has a value, so as a percentage, what would your contribution to this ecosystem be?<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s assume that you charge an hourly rate of $200 and it took you 500 hours to make your plugin, that would be a $100k valuation on your contribution, could be an over or under estimate, but I think it reasonable for the purposes of this thought experiment. Now let\u2019s assume that all the ChatGPT models cost 1 billion to train, no idea if that is accurate but it seems in the right ballpark.<\/p>\n<p>That would mean that your contribution is 100k from 1 billion, expressed as a % that would be %0.01 so a fair payment distribution based on the value of the initial contribution would be for every $1 made by a plugin, OpenAI will get $0.9999 and you get $0.0001.<\/p>\n<p>One of the issues as I see it, is that you are assuming that the very reason people come to use your plugin, i.e. the fact that the AI is so good, is worth nothing and you should be the sole receiver of all the revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Few things: In my opinion, that clause in their docs is referring to our ability to charge customers THROUGH the ChatGPT platform.<\/p>\n<p>You simply cannot argue that OpenAI is unaware or hasn\u2019t given \u201cpermission\u201d, when Zapier and  most of the other plugins first released require paid subscriptions after you exhaust their free tier.<\/p>\n<p>They also review the plugins. I submitted mine twice,  the second time using a third party auth platform that has monetization \u0253aked into their OAS manifests that we proxy through.<\/p>\n<p>Regarding the more ideological part:<\/p>\n<p>Youre conflating valuation with overhead costs (also comparing training cost vs personal time invested doesnt track) and with the value of utility.<\/p>\n<p>You can\u2019t discuss \u201ccontribution to an ecosystem\u201d as a metric while leaving out that we all pay OpenAI for the ability to develop on their platform AND that every single user utilizing plugins are already paying OpenAI to access plugins.<\/p>\n<p>The notion that fair market distribution of earnings is defined by dev overhead cost,  flies in the face of every single existing third- party product system: Does Apple take 99 99999% of app store earnings? Does Sony take the same from Playstation developers? Wordpress? Google with Chrome extensions?<\/p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"Foxabilo\" data-post=\"6\" data-topic=\"331899\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"><\/div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https:\/\/sea2.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/user_avatar\/community.openai.com\/foxabilo\/48\/249899_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> Foxabilo:<\/div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of the issues as I see it, is that you are assuming that the very reason people come to use your plugin, i.e. the fact that the AI is so good, is worth nothing and you should be the sole receiver of all the revenue.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/aside>\n<p>That\u2019s a ridiculous assertion. In your eyes any third party developer inherently believes that the platform they build on is worthless without their contribution?<\/p>\n<p>The reality is that plugin developers contribute to customer acquisition, retention,  and most of all we are creating an insane amount of highly-specific training data that OpenAI simply would never have access to otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>Plugin devs aren\u2019t all making fluff either. We help fill in gaps that OpenAI doesn\u2019t have the time or agility to tackle efficiently.<\/p>\n<p>We help actively solve non-trivial problems, as well as passively build the most valuable training dataset on the planet.<\/p>\n<p>Should Youtube or TikTok creators make any money?<\/p>\n<p>But MOST of all\u2026 you\u2019re making the assumption that OpenAI is mistakenly leaving money on the table.  Don\u2019t you think they\u2019ve ran the numbers on this?<\/p>\n<p>They make more money BECAUSE of plugin developers, whether its off of the customer metrics i mentioned earlier or simply off of the unprecedentedly rich data we all produce.<\/p>\n<p>To be frank, there should be a creator fund.<\/p>\n<p>I agree that a good plugin has the potential to generate new users, but right now, this second, the plugins are the ones using the base created by OpenAI, that may change in the future when people think \u201cOh, I need to use XYZ plugin to solve this problem I have\u201d and then proceed to create a pay monthly Plus account in  order to use that, and perhaps other, plugins.<\/p>\n<p>This is absolutely an area that will develop and be explored, I wanted to give a counterpoint to the \u201cI should be able to charge for my plugin\u201d narrative.<\/p>\n<p>Hi <a class=\"mention\" href=\"\/u\/bizupserv\">@bizupserv<\/a>, have you explored affiliate links for Custom GPT\u2019s?

        "Question":"<p>I have pondered a lot about whether or not I should make this thread. But I will do so, since OpenAI customer service is unavailable (there is some kind of loop: FAQs invite me to start a chat with customer service from within ChatGPT; once I am in, I press the help button as instructed and am redirected to FAQs\u2026 GPT itself says I have been put in a \u201cCatch-22 situation\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>Fact is, I think that safe practices are not being enforced by OpenAI, which is itself a severe breach of their own ethical code. I have browsed time and again the plug-ins and all I could see are sloppy legal guarantees, bare minimum customer relations, and even some cases of tracking and phishing. It is usually hard to understand under which legal framework developers are releasing their work and <strong>since it is not possible to leave a review<\/strong>, the user is left to her own devices.<\/p>\n<p>I will make here some examples:<br>\n[i] <strong>This disclaimer is devoid of legal value in most countries:<\/strong> ht tps:\/\/plugin-3c56b9d4c8a6465998395f28b6a445b2-jexkai4vea-uc.a.run.app\/legal.html<br>\n[ii] <strong>(Access PDF and DOCs) Also this one:<\/strong> htt ps:\/\/pdf.accessplugins.com\/legal-info<br>\n[iii] <strong>(Ask the Code) The statements have no legal value in my country:<\/strong> ht tps:\/\/docs.askthecode.ai\/legal\/<br>\n[iv]  <strong>(Smart Slides) This plugin \"developer\u2019s page provides aboslutely no valuable context on its nature and operations:<\/strong> ht tps:\/\/smart-slides.co\/<br>\n[v]  <strong>This licence is simply non-existent:<\/strong> ht tps:\/\/chat.openai.com\/xapi.lihaorui.com\/legal<br>\n[vi] <strong>This licence is for the wrong product (ChatWithPDF instead of ChatWithVideo):<\/strong> ht tps:\/\/chatwithvideo.sdan.io\/legal<br>\n<em>(apparently, I cannot include links in my posts)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Another worrysome part of all of this is that I have no specific connections to the above plugins. I am just browsing the plugin store at random and clicking here and there and finding these situations continuosly.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, <strong>my deepest respect for developers who did all their dues<\/strong>. However, fact is, OpenAI cannot <em>police<\/em> all external content (and it would be beyond expectations to do so). It cannot check every single developer and every single country. And that is precisely why we need a user-driven reporting system or revieweing system to make developers accountable for what they do.<\/p>\n<p>I think I am not asking for the Moon here\u2026 just a basic Likert scale next to each item in the plugin store and a comment box.<\/p>",
        "Replies":"<p>Hi and welcome to the Developer Forum!<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a fair point, I think there should be some allowance for the fact the entire system is less than 12 months old and the plugins side of things is much less. It will take time to build these kinds of feedback mechanisms and to find ones that work by applying the right kind of pressure at the right points.<\/p>\n<p>I hope you will stick around and make your voice heard when you see bad practices. I will certainly do all I can to make sure you are heard.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you. It appears that this system is more recent than I thought. Considering this, my tone would be way more charitable. I wish I could support that type of implementation in some way, but I am afraid I lack the appropriate IT and customer service skills.<\/p>\n<p>Now that you make me think of that, an idea crossed my mind. In academic journals we have an \u201caccreditation system\u201d for policies, copyrights, and licensing, called Sherpa Romeo. It is just a repository, but basically it features a series of options that managers can \u201ctick\u201d and, in the end, policies will be permanently recorded on the database, with a timestamp (much like a notary) and in a fully transparent way.<\/p>\n<p>That could be a bit of a far shot for commercial developers, given the diverse and changing nature of commercial goals. However, such a platform could be useful to interact with complex legal frameworks such as the European Data Protection Law. In my vision, each developed plugin would link back to a \u201cmirror\u201d page that presents all the key information of the plugin, in a synthetic yet effective way.<\/p>\n<p>This goes beyond the ranking and reviewing system\u2026 it is more like a set of boxes you fill in to display compliance in a transparent way. But careful balance needs to be found between bureaucracy and creativity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Quick update on my current research: I have asked GPT 4.0 to assess the terms and conditions of a plugin<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>1. My prompt<\/strong><br>\nHere are the terms and conditions of ChatWithPlugins, directly downloaded from the website:<\/p>\n<p>\"Introduction<br>\nThis legal disclaimer applies to the usage of the (OMITTED FOR PRIVACY) (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cPlugin\u201d) hosted on ( HOST NAME ).

GPT\u2019s answer<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>*The terms and conditions you\u2019ve provided appear to be fairly standard for a service like ChatWithPlugins. They cover various aspects such as the purpose of the Plugin, limitations of liability, third-party content, and copyright issues. However, there are a few points you might want to consider:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Accuracy and Completeness<\/strong>: The terms state that while the Plugin aims to provide accurate information, it makes no warranties about the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of the information. This means you should double-check any data you receive from the Plugin.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Limitation of Liability<\/strong>: The Plugin is not liable for any damages, whether direct or indirect, that may arise from using the service. This is a common clause but worth noting.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Third-Party Content<\/strong>: The Plugin may process links to third-party websites but is not responsible for the content or availability of these sites.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Governing Law<\/strong>: The terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the Plugin\u2019s owner is located. This could be important if any legal issues arise.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Contact Information<\/strong>: They provide an email for support, but no physical address is mentioned.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Nothing appears to be \u201cfishy\u201d per se, but these are points you might want to be aware of when using the service. Would you like to discuss any specific section in more detail?*<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Another question<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Where is the Plugin Owner based, then? What is the governing law in this scenario?<\/p>\n<p>Also, I am concerned that limitations of liability are just legalese but, in fact, in my country, you may decline liability only as far as the law allows you to. If the law says you are liable, such statement has absolutely no value.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Answer<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The terms and conditions don\u2019t specify where the Plugin\u2019s owner is located, which is the jurisdiction that would govern any legal issues. This is a point that might warrant further investigation if you\u2019re considering a subscription.<\/p>\n<p>As for the limitations of liability, you\u2019re correct that such clauses are often subject to local laws. In many jurisdictions, including likely your own, companies can\u2019t fully absolve themselves of liability through a terms of service agreement, especially for issues like gross negligence or willful misconduct. The clause is standard legalese, but its enforceability would depend on the specific legal regulations in your country.<\/p>\n<p>If you have concerns about these aspects, it would be advisable to consult with a legal advisor to understand how these terms might interact with the laws applicable to you. Would you like to explore this further?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The one I analysed is a very reliable plugin but, as it could be seen, it escapes all sort of prosecution. Does not give away its physical address yet makes statements concerning its governing law (?).<\/p>\n<p>Since that plugin is very good, in my opinion, that could be a <strong>starting point<\/strong> or benchmark to build upon.<\/p>\n<p>I will keep you updated.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Update (Sep 29, 2023)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Tired of services not working properly, and for lack of a reporting system embedded in the plugins\u2019 section of GPT 4.0, I accessed a thread concerning a plugin and, upon collecting evidence of the developer having made himself scarce in the past 60 days (notwithstanding his September blog posts boasting his wealth \u2013 at the expense of customers!).<\/p>\n<p>After collecting such evidence, I directed some users to file appropriate reports with the consumer protection authorities of the billing State (Delaware) and of the State of residence of the culprit (California). I also provided accurate information concerning all the addresses and links hosted by the plugin developer\u2019s website.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, <strong>my post advocating legal action against the scam was hidden and censored by community members who appear to me to be clearly afraid of saying the truth about what is currently going on with the legality of certain plugins that are being freely distributed through GPT 4.0.<\/strong> I thought we could postpone this discussion, but it is evident <strong>we need to have this discussion now.<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(there is some kind of loop: FAQs invite me to start a chat with customer service from within ChatGPT; once I am in, I press the help button as instructed and am redirected to FAQs\u2026 GPT itself says I have been put in a \u201cCatch-22 situation\u201d).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Have you been able to contact support directly?

        "Replies":"<p>None of that is possible.<\/p>\n<p>GPTs are a feature only available to ChatGPT Plus subscribers within the chat webpage or app.<\/p>\n<p>Each version of the model is a distinct architecture with its own parameters and capabilities. You typically can\u2019t run a model trained on GPT-4 on GPT-3.5 turbo directly.<\/p>\n<p>If possible, add the option for a better choice, such as GPT-3.5 (0301,0613,1106), GPT-4 (0314,0613,1106).<\/p>\n<p>Within ChatGPT, they often may have trials of different preview models going to selected users. You might have seen lots of requests for feedback, such as the normal thumbs up, \u201chow\u2019s this conversation\u201d, or even a pop-up asking which of two is best.<\/p>\n<p>Selecting your own model works against this.<\/p>\n<p>API model selection is pretty much not an option. Earlier ones are not trained on the same chat container format, don\u2019t call functions or have tuning needed for GPTs, and simply do not have \u201csafety\u201d or \u201cefficiency\u201d that OpenAI wants to impose.<\/p>\n<p>If you want API features, like integrating AI in other products, you pay for the API.<\/p>\n<p>I am willing to pay for the OpenAI API.<\/p>\n<p>How do I make my custom model on GPT 4 available to common users through Whatsapp?<\/p>\n<p>A GPT can be shared, but only can be used by subscribers of <strong>ChatGPT Plus<\/strong>. Without that, others will just see a button that upgrade is required.<\/p>\n<p>With the API, you can develop your own solution, but there is no \u201csharing\u201d and having someone directly interact with OpenAI.<\/p>\n<p>With API, you must develop an AI product on your own server, and also should have the accountability of user accounts, sending user inputs to the safety moderator AI first, and all other things that comes with operating such a service where you are paying for other\u2019s usage by the amount of language data.<\/p>\n<p>A similar question. I\u2019ve been conversing with my Custom GPT using the voice option in the Android App. But I use it quite a bit and run out of my allotted time.  I don\u2019t need  to share it with anyone, but I wonder if I can run it on GPT 3.5 instead?<\/p>\n<p>You have a great question and an interesting case. For those with Plus, why not GPTs on 3.5?<\/p>\n<p>About the only caveat that would prevent GPTs from using the 3.5 model is the model\u2019s lower context length for understanding instructions, data, and lengthy conversations, and the cognitive abilities to correctly use functions such as browse with Bing and to write code without errors.<\/p>\n<p>Your own GPTs could accommodate those limitations when targeting 3.5, just as API developers do when making custom AI applications.<\/p>\n<p>For now, GPT is a feature only enabled by use of the GPT-4 ChatGPT model.<\/p>\n<p>+1 for this.<\/p>\n<p>I have similar issue as I created a \u201cquick dictionary\u201d which is not quick enough when running on GPT-4. The ability to run it on 3.5 would be very helpful.<\/p>\n<p>Note: When you create a custom GPT,  no new model is created in the technical sense. The custom GPT is just extra instructions and data for the based model.<\/p>",

        "Replies":"<p>I don\u2019t have an answer, but I\u2019m trying to do the same thing and running into a similar issue. I believe the custom GPT has to type out (generate) the whole post body sent with the request, meaning that it would have to type out a <strong>huge<\/strong> base64 string, even for smaller images. I\u2019m not really sure if there\u2019s a way to get the image itself into the API though.<\/p>\n<p>I tried converting to base64 first and it did end up stalling the program. But I don\u2019t think it would use base64 encoding for normal file uploads if you don\u2019t specify to.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m having the same issue. It doesn\u2019t seem to want to type out the entire base64 value to upload the image no matter what I try. Have you guys been able to fix it?<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve noticed an issue where the request body for a POST can only be a certain length, before it explodes when calling the action. It\u2019s not that big a length, either. I doubt it will be able to handle sending across an image regardless of the format. Maybe try it with like a 2x2 image and see if that works, then we\u2019ll know for sure I guess.<\/p>\n<p>I convert the image into a base64-encoded data URL. I can transfer images of 16x16, but it does not work even for images of 32x32 or larger. <img src=\"https:\/\/emoji.discourse-cdn.com\/twitter\/frowning.png?v=12\" title=\":frowning:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":frowning:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><\/p>\n<p>Having the same issue here, I tried defining a multipart\/form-data request and it didn\u2019t work and also tried encoding the file as a base64 string but chatgpt refuses to write it completely (which kind of makes sense, it\u2019s huge).<br>\nHas anyone found a solution?<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m wondering if we can ask the ChatGPT to using data analysis tool to write code to call into the action api, I know for sure the data analysis tool has access to the images uploaded, but I haven\u2019t tested the idea yet.<\/p>\n<p>Right now the code interpreter cannot use the requests library. Hence it cannot send or receive data over the internet.<\/p>\n<p>Couldn\u2019t  a GPT engineer come and just straight up answer if sending files on a post request using GPT actions is outside of GPT\u2019s capabilities ?? kind of annoying that there is no clear answer even if everything points that is not, or even if they plan to allow it in the future.<\/p>\n<p>There is a clear answer to this. Here it is:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Making http request is not possible, so you can\u2019t just upload a file to the server from a blob like you can do on frontend.<\/li>\n<li>You can use code interpretor to turn the file into base64 and send it like this. But the GPT cuts the file, so you only send like 500 characters (&lt;1%) - so it also doesn\u2019t work.<\/li>\n<li>You can instruct the gpt to send the base64 in chunks of 500 characters, and then assemble it into a file on your server, but it will take like 60 requests to send an image.<br>\nSo direct file sending is hard, if not impossible now.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Is anyone able to sort this out please?<\/p>\n<p>We are stuck at the same.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>I hope this can be addressed soon too. I think the ability to send images via actions would open the door for many great possibilities<\/p>\n<p>If there\u2019s no way to send the uploaded image to action, how are some other gpts implemented?<br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/original\/4X\/f\/d\/7\/fd781b383f5a2470f7ea8a0b37f67f95cba9d3f3.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"\/uploads\/short-url\/Aai7QOrG7T1C4jlxJaGPZ213lxF.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"1705922868591\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/optimized\/4X\/f\/d\/7\/fd781b383f5a2470f7ea8a0b37f67f95cba9d3f3_2_690x347.jpeg\" alt=\"1705922868591\" data-base62-sha1=\"Aai7QOrG7T1C4jlxJaGPZ213lxF\" width=\"690\" height=\"347\" srcset=\"https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/optimized\/4X\/f\/d\/7\/fd781b383f5a2470f7ea8a0b37f67f95cba9d3f3_2_690x347.jpeg, https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/optimized\/4X\/f\/d\/7\/fd781b383f5a2470f7ea8a0b37f67f95cba9d3f3_2_1035x520.jpeg 1.5x, https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/original\/4X\/f\/d\/7\/fd781b383f5a2470f7ea8a0b37f67f95cba9d3f3.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F5F4F3\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"><\/use><\/svg><span class=\"filename\">1705922868591<\/span><span class=\"informations\">1036\u00d7522 43 KB<\/span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"><\/use><\/svg><\/div><\/a><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The best way right now is to have user to upload the image somewhere and then give the GPT the URL to that image, so your server can process it.<\/p>\n<p>I understand it is not the best experience, but it will get you there.

Upon further investigation and multiple test installations and uninstallations from the plugin store, our team replicated the same issue.

It appears that ChatGPT fails to complete the OAuth flow. Specifically, ChatGPT does not initiate a POST request to the authorization_url , leading to the aforementioned error.<\/p>\n<p>We suspect that there might be an underlying issue on your end that is causing this malfunction. Your prompt assistance in investigating and resolving this matter would be greatly appreciated, as it is impacting our user experience significantly.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for your attention to this urgent issue.

Github connection is back up. Also two things: I didnt expect people to use the full tree url, so I\u2019ll correct for that. Your repo was also timing out the API pull.<\/p>\n<p>ChatGPT has a pretty strict timeout limit in my opinion, especially with functions.  Why cant we stream lol\u2026I digress. I cut the depth that the initiating call tries to pull from 10 to 5. This just means that you might need to ask it to open a folder rather than have the ENTIRE codebase visible at once.<\/p>\n<p>My pleasure, let me know what you think! I\u2019m too consumed with building this that i havent really tested the other ones much.<\/p>\n<p>AskYourCode solved this by downloading the codebase as the first plugin request. So you can start chatting with it after that in the second message.<br>\nNoteable has a similar issue with code execution. It makes multiple calles to check on the progress of the code execution but if it takes to long, it will also ask you to wait and send a new chat.<\/p>\n<p>Yeah Viktor and I talked a bunch before either of us got on the store, and frankly I wanted to try a different method.<\/p>\n<p>While downloading the repo first helps navigate some issues with larger codebases, I believe we had some discussion about how it didn\u2019t make the model any more insightful.  Maybe hes found a way to boost that capability though.  I will say that I think the other methods out seem to limit what languages can be processed?<\/p>\n<p>I wanted to make a conscious effort to use as few services and back-end steps as possible.<\/p>\n<p>I think there\u2019s untapped potential in tweaking the language that directs the model (and treating the overall architecture of the plugin as \u201clanguage\u201d) in using the data, rather than the sophistication\/complexity of the systems providing it.<\/p>\n<p>With the right structure and instructing methods, I think ChatGPT can fully navigate and \u201creason\u201d its way through a codebase in the exact same way we do, without any extra steps.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ll keep you guys updated on my changes and id love to hear how your experiences vary across these different but similar tools <img src=\"https:\/\/emoji.discourse-cdn.com\/twitter\/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><\/p>\n<p>Love to give it a whirl, just need that Plugin that enables 48 hours in a day\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Hello all,<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m going unverified to onboard OAuth.

        "Replies":"<p>Hi and welcome to the Developer Forum!<\/p>\n<p>Looking at the prompt, you are telling the model to look for the LOVs (List of values?) in B2, at no point do you say to look for anything similar, or close to that, also how similar? how would you define the amount of sameness these values are permitted to have? can they be 0.000001 different? or is a difference of 10000000 ok?<\/p>\n<p>You need to be very exact with what you want the model to do and what restrictions there on on it\u2019s ability to make decisions for itself.<\/p>\n<p>I was working on a system using GPT-3.5 that is capable of finding out what kind of techniques or programming languages are used in a dataset.<\/p>\n<p>And it even found stuff like this:<\/p>\n&lt;?php\n\n$skills = ['C#', ....\n\n\n--- \n\nThe task was to find the skills used in it and since there was a variable called skills and it had an array of \"skills\" it also found them.\n\nI second that.

When you start a conversation with the zapier plugin enabled, they must be injecting the enabled actions into that file b\/c if you look at the zapier plugin debug windows the endpoints have UID\u2019s.  Not to mention that the URL to the zapier OAS file has the word \u201cdynamic\u201d in its path as a clue.  Other developers who have changed their OAS file have been kicked out of the store.<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know how else to explain this: <a href=\"https:\/\/openai.com\/policies\/plugin-terms\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Plugin terms<\/a><\/p>\n<p>OpenAI can do whatever they want with the things we\u2019re building on their platform. The landscape has changed since most of these plugins were accepted into the store. If anyone has a plugin that doesn\u2019t fit the terms and resubmits, it\u2019s their prerogative to reject it.<\/p>\n<p>With the release of Code Interpreter, OpenAI is most likely covering their liability bases at this point. Not allowing additional  ways for users to direct ChatGPT to write and execute code makes sense. They can only really vet their own security and dont\u2019 want to be held liable if some 3rd party developer jailbreaks something and claims they could only do with the use of ChatGPT.<\/p>\n<p>I have a question about people getting kicked from the store and the Zapier claim\u2026 Their docs say that the only thing that will get you kicked out is if your ai-plugin.json manifest is changed.<br>\nI haven\u2019t seen proof that making a change to ONLY your OAS file kicks you from the store, and Ive changed mine without effect.<\/p>\n<p>Zapier doesn\u2019t have any special permissions, they are following the rules and framework according to the Docs. From what I gather, they are using a OAS generator that creates an unique spec file for the specific user based on what zaps they are using. If there is a threshold for OAS changes before it affects GPT\u2019s interaction with the plugin, then I\u2019m sure Zapier knows where it is.<\/p>\n<p>The way these very normal enforcements of policy are being represented as unfair or negligent isn\u2019t accurate nor constructive.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not saying that the <em>audacity of this predicament doth not diverge so remarkably from our aspirations<\/em>, and that people don\u2019t deserve to be mad about the changes in the environment, but lets stop trying to rally pitchforks around false narratives.<\/p>",

The issue is that OpenAI doesn\u2019t recognise the format and start analizing it as text (that\u2019s very bad design by OpenAI). The work around was a intermediate server that will take the image save, upload it to third party hosting and return URL. But i doubt that you can take Dalle image and upload it or take it as input for the API. To do that ypu would need to build something on the top of the browser or webpage. But you can also use OpenAI API to generate images.<\/p>\n<p>once these GPTs can pull images from URLs \u2026 you are golden! good luck!<\/p>",

I have created 6 custom GPt\u2019s so far but I can\u2019t seem to find a clear path to charge for these. I have explored putting them on custom websites with a subscription based access model perhaps. However this is not user friendly or easy. All this among the backdrop of the GPT store, which  will not yield any significant reward for 99% of developers, as there is simply too much competition.<\/p>\n<p>Any thoughts on how one might go about monetizing custom GPT\u2019s built through openai, that might actually yield some significant revenue?<\/p>",

Since ChatGPT is open-source and we all come from different backgrounds, not everyone here is a programmer. But we all have great ideas, right? So, why not let us add different tools, like plugins , to our GPT setups easily?<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s my case: I tried making a GPT project called Matspar Bergen, <a href=\"https:\/\/chat.openai.com\/g\/g-ikaF9gFOW-matspar-bergen\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ChatGPT - MatSpar Bergen<\/a> . The goal was to search the web for the cheapest food prices in my city. But, I found out that GPT can\u2019t do web scraping on its own. And, since I\u2019m not a programmer, paying around 50 dollars for a scraping service like ScrapingBee , <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scrapingbee.com\/#pricing\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ScrapingBee, the best web scraping API.<\/a> \u2013 and then giving away my tokens for it \u2013 doesn\u2019t really work for me. I mean, I\u2019m trying to cut down my grocery bills, not spend more on coding stuff!<\/p>\n<p>So, what do you  think, Samuel Harris Altman ? Could adding a plugin feature to GPT  help connect our cool ideas with the technical part? This could really help people like me, who aren\u2019t coders but still want to add something new and useful to our community.<\/p>\n<p>Can\u2019t wait to hear what you think!<\/p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nCarlos Carpio<\/p>",

No need to actually use the code, just follow the approach.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sisbell\/ok-ziggy-tools\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https:\/\/github.githubassets.com\/favicons\/favicon.svg\" class=\"site-icon\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\">\n\n      <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sisbell\/ok-ziggy-tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub<\/a>\n  <\/header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690\/345;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/optimized\/3X\/8\/a\/8ab39c621bd2eabc89d1154b8e705b73bb6a4f49_2_690x345.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"E7EDED\" width=\"690\" height=\"345\" srcset=\"https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/optimized\/3X\/8\/a\/8ab39c621bd2eabc89d1154b8e705b73bb6a4f49_2_690x345.png, https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/optimized\/3X\/8\/a\/8ab39c621bd2eabc89d1154b8e705b73bb6a4f49_2_1035x517.png 1.5x, https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/original\/3X\/8\/a\/8ab39c621bd2eabc89d1154b8e705b73bb6a4f49.png 2x\"><\/div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sisbell\/ok-ziggy-tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub - sisbell\/ok-ziggy-tools: A build tool for creating a catalog intended...<\/a><\/h3>\n\n  <p>A build tool for creating a catalog intended for consumption by large language model chatbots. - GitHub - sisbell\/ok-ziggy-tools: A build tool for creating a catalog intended for consumption by lar...<\/p>\n\n\n  <\/article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  <\/div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\n<\/aside>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sisbell\/ok-ziggy\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https:\/\/github.githubassets.com\/favicons\/favicon.svg\" class=\"site-icon\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\">\n\n      <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sisbell\/ok-ziggy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub<\/a>\n  <\/header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690\/345;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/optimized\/3X\/a\/4\/a4299c59a8e151bc0cc01255eaadf19985ca7791_2_690x345.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"EAEEEE\" width=\"690\" height=\"345\" srcset=\"https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/optimized\/3X\/a\/4\/a4299c59a8e151bc0cc01255eaadf19985ca7791_2_690x345.png, https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/optimized\/3X\/a\/4\/a4299c59a8e151bc0cc01255eaadf19985ca7791_2_1035x517.png 1.5x, https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/original\/3X\/a\/4\/a4299c59a8e151bc0cc01255eaadf19985ca7791.png 2x\"><\/div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sisbell\/ok-ziggy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub - sisbell\/ok-ziggy: A dynamic proxy, enabling seamless interaction...<\/a><\/h3>\n\n  <p>A dynamic proxy, enabling seamless interaction with multiple services via  OpenAPI Specification. - GitHub - sisbell\/ok-ziggy: A dynamic proxy, enabling seamless interaction with multiple services ...<\/p>\n\n\n  <\/article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  <\/div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"><\/div>\n<\/aside>\n\n<p>Hi, guys just need a quick confirmation - Can i make a change to my open API spec without getting delisted?

I was able to bypass the warning message and install it anyway; fyi in case this is a deterrent for new users.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for the opportunity to test out the plugin, \u2013Justin<\/p>\n<p>Sent your feedback to the plugin creator!<\/p>\n<p>Thanks for letting me know, I really appreciate it <img src=\"https:\/\/emoji.discourse-cdn.com\/twitter\/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><\/p>\n<p>Hi,<br>\nI\u2019m the plugin creator. Sorry for the inconvenience !<br>\nThe plugin currently supports 2 features :<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>list events in your calendar between 2 dates. This feature was added just now.<\/li>\n<li>insert new events (both events with day + start and end times and full day (or several full days) events are supported)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In order to use it, you can for instance ask chat GPT to<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>list all events in your calendar this week,<\/li>\n<li>add an event called \u201cimportant meeting\u201d next monday from 1PM to 3PM.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The next features I have in mind for the near future are editing events, and bulk actions (being able to add several or edit several elements at a time).<br>\nI would love to have your thoughts on those, and to read other features you would like the plugin to support !<\/p>\n<p>About the google warning, I have done everything they require me to do, and I\u2019m waiting their review and hopefully validation ! <img src=\"https:\/\/emoji.discourse-cdn.com\/twitter\/pray.png?v=12\" title=\":pray:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":pray:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><\/p>\n<p>I will keep you guys updated here !<br>\nThank you very much for the valuable insights and ideas !<\/p>\n<p>-Alexis<\/p>\n<p>Thank you, Alexis. Yes, bulk actions, such as inputting a large number of calendar entries prompted by simple text, and also AI-facilitated interpretation of text instructions that can be generalized to inputting many calendar entries, such as inputting a weekly event with a predictable pattern of changes to the event in each week during a sequence\u2014also the ability to have AI examine a calendar intelligently and make patterns of changes affecting large time spans in the calendar (without generating unintended duplicates) would be great.<\/p>\n<p>For example, using the competitor plugin TimeNavi I had another plugin examine a PDF with a table of many key dates in over a dozen area school calendars with TimeNavi tasked to input all of those dates. It worked but many duplicates were created and the time span for day-long events was set from 12:00AM\u201311:59PM in almost all cases; and certain events were skipped without explanation. So TimeNavi did okay but in the end created time-consuming mistakes requiring human cleanup. So a frontrunner plugin would tackle a similar task with a more accurate result.<\/p>\n<p>One thing I\u2019ve noticed when playing with AI plugins is that some of them, including TimeNavi, fall prey to \u201cfake data\u201d and then act on that data as if it were real, such as ChatGPT claiming the existence of a number of calendar events that were never there, and then a plugin attempting to act on the non-existing events (and in the process creating them). This has rather serious consequences for folks sharing the calendar and wondering where the phantom events came from. Hope this lands in context and that you can make use of this feedback. With appreciation,  \u2013Justin<\/p>\n<p>Thank you very much, adding one or several \u201csmart\u201d layers in the plugin to detect potential errors, and offer smoot interactions for more complex tasks is a promising idea. I\u2019m putting it into the roadmap. I\u2019ll let you know when I\u2019ll publish updates on the plugin !<br>\n-Alexis<\/p>\n<p>Thank you again for your time and beneificial efforts!<\/p>\n<p>Can I somehow use the plugin also in the MY GPT through the action? How can I do that?<\/p>\n<p>I Love this, could you please share the link for the repo.<\/p>\n<p>I created one chrome extension. Search for \u201cChatgpt for google calendar\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Just installed it. Thank you for addressing this important niche for AI.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you Alexis!  I just added it. I have multiple google calendars. I tried to add it to different calendars but it seems you can only add the calendar entry to your primary calendar. Is that true?<\/p>",

Make do with what we have.<\/p>\n<p>Still, it\u2019s based on the revenue data available. Which could be read as being from Mobile+Plus, but still. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll jump more than an order of magnitude, which still leaves top creators making very very little in comparison to other 2-sided marketplaces.<\/p>\n<p>Granted, (and I appreciate your pushback) if the number is 10% of users are plus (which would already make them the most valuable private company), the earnings for the \u201cBig winners\u201d could be 120k a year\u2026 which is a third of what you can get with a normal job programming in the Bay area. And this is by building a tool that can be replicated pretty easily. No moat and very little reward.<\/p>\n<p>I am pretty sure it\u2019s a bit under 10 million.<\/p>\n<p>This forum has half a million users and they are a very small fraction of people that have made use of the API, an even more niche and pay to use group, so\u2026 I think that number is not a bit off I think it\u2019s way off.<\/p>\n<p>I would argue there is no direct correlation between those that have logged in at least one to the only active support they can find for their issue (be it API, prompting, announcements\u2026) and those that pay 20$\/mo consistently for Plus.<\/p>\n<p>But then again, just some estimate based on available information. I would love to get closer to a real number. How would you estimate the total addressable market of the GPT Store for creators?<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d say its a million+ as a minimum.<\/p>\n<p>(more words)<\/p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"jorgeintegrait\" data-post=\"10\" data-topic=\"581293\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"><\/div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https:\/\/sea2.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/user_avatar\/community.openai.com\/jorgeintegrait\/48\/159095_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> jorgeintegrait:<\/div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How would you estimate the total addressable market of the GPT Store for creators?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/aside>\n<p>There are many factors you can use, GPT conversations, forum members, OAI Staff members. One of the most popular GPTs has 400,000+ conversations. Most of the time people have one conversation with a GPT get bored then never use it again.<\/p>\n<p>Using your preferred from any or all of those, what would be your current estimate of paying Plus, Teams &amp; Enterprise users?<\/p>\n<p>A million users is still less than an order of magnitude of change. The estimate moves from 12k\/yr to 48k, quite low still.<\/p>\n<p>I hope you can agree with my primary point, being that revenue share will not be the main source of income for successful creators, but rather the integration with other services that will require separate subscriptions\/micropayments.<\/p>\n<p>Similar to how it happened in the AppStore, but removing the option of ad rev.<\/p>\n<p>I would say around 8-9 million from what I have heard from OAI staff.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s completely reasonable not to put all eggs in one basket but instead think ahead and look for other ways to monetize in case the revenue sharing mechanism does not cover all the costs.<\/p>\n<p>The way how one can use a GPT to earn some income in a way that matches their business model, is exactly dependent on what the business is.<br>\nPersonally I believe a freemium model is a good enough suggestion for many builders. But then we have to talk about the actual implementation of such a approach, which is doable but requires additional development.<\/p>\n<p>What are your thoughts?<\/p>\n<p>I used PluginLab for plugins. They build a proxy that sits in the middle of the API backend and ChatGPT. It was easy to set a free quota and then charge beyond that. the same thing will still work with GPTs\u2026 it\u2019s just that I think end user AKA customer expectations changed now with the GPT Store.<\/p>\n<p>It depends mostly on the type of service you provide and your cost structure.<\/p>\n<p>Freemium is nice if you think users will want to go beyond it, be it with more usage or more features. It is also only feasible if either your cost of acquisition and free runs is low or if you have the financial backing and conversion rates that justify the free service just to get a percentage of those as paying customers eventually.<\/p>\n<p>Freemium models worked great in web2.0 where you could at least cover some costs with advertisement, but this is not really possible (mostly) when interating with your service through a GPT.<\/p>\n<p>So, freemium models may need to become more restrictive than in the past, and at the same time increase their conversion rates. There will be some winners, but less and further between than in other 2-sided marketplaces.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re gonna go with a freemium model, and you have enough resources to push through the early curve, I\u2019d encourage to have it be full-featured but very limited on usage. You can also implement multiple payment models. Most new AI apps go with credits for low monthly subs, but I also like the pay-as-you-go of Dall-e 2 as a feasible option. I think we will see a rise of microtransactions in the GPT store.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>User: Create a video from the images we just generated<\/li>\n<li>GPT: \"Oh you want another video made but run out of credits. Say \u2018get more credits\u2019 and we will load an extra 100 credits from your card on file \"<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/emoji.discourse-cdn.com\/twitter\/wink.png?v=12\" title=\":wink:\" class=\"emoji only-emoji\" alt=\":wink:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><\/p>\n<p>What other strategies have you seen or plan on exploring?<\/p>\n<p>Agreed. These micropayment credits could be handled by an aggregator service such that when a user tops up their prepaid account it can be used for any participating GPT.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks for sharing your perspective on the problem!<\/p>\n<p>I agree that the lack of \u201cpayments\u201d inside the ChatGPT interface is the biggest question mark right now.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time we know that OpenAI is trying to get more users for their ChatGPT service.<\/p>\n<p>They incentivize developers to build GPTs but until now only with the promise of revenue sharing.<\/p>\n<p>Thus if we drive new paying customers to their site, or if the paying customers return to use our GPTs then we potentially have a win-win situation.<br>\nThis model would be similar to YouTube for example where content creators get paid to keep viewers on the platform.<\/p>\n<p>From there we have to ask where the money to be shared will be coming from.<br>\nObviously there is only a limited amount of Plus money to be distributed. Looking at YouTube we know how they fight to keep the platform profitable with many ads and without add blockers and extra transactions on top.<\/p>\n<p>Following this line of thinking \u201crevenue sharing\u201d would be \u201cad revenue sharing\u201d with a very, very low payout per transaction. But this is not going to drive builders to create GPTs for ChatGPT.<\/p>\n<p>We have to expect that there will be a solution offered by OpenAI besides revenue sharing. And that would be a \u201cpaid action\u201d feature that does exactly what is written on the box and drives earnings for both: the developer and OpenAI.<\/p>",

        "Replies":"<p>After some research, I figured that OpenAI sends a <code>state<\/code> parameter when it sends the <code>scope<\/code>  and the <code>redirect_uri<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>However, that is not documented. Here\u2019s what the doc says:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>When a user logs into the plugin, ChatGPT will direct the user\u2019s browser to <code>\"[client_url]?response_type=code&amp;client_id=[client_id]&amp;scope=[scope]&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fchat.openai.com%2Faip%2F[plugin_id]%2Foauth%2Fcallback\"<\/code><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>So I\u2019m now appending this <code>state<\/code> parameter to the <code>redirect_uri<\/code> just next to the <code>code<\/code> parameter.<\/p>\n<p>This solves the issue.<\/p>\n<p>The thing is, it seems this state parameter is not documented at all and moreover it was not something blocking before. So I guess many developers are facing this issue now.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"\/u\/logankilpatrick\">@logankilpatrick<\/a> could you confirm that is something we should do? Since it\u2019s not documented, I don\u2019t want to make a mistake.<\/p>\n<p>Hey<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s a problem we are also facing, I agree this needs clarification<\/p>\n<p>Hi <a class=\"mention\" href=\"\/u\/kevinpiac\">@kevinpiac<\/a>  and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"\/u\/aurelle\">@aurelle<\/a>,<br>\nThanks a lot for the report! I am facing the same problem.<br>\nTo clarify the solution, what value did you add for state parameter?<br>\n<code>{redirect_url}?code={OPENAI_OAUTH_TOKEN}&amp;state=???<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Actually, when ChatGPT redirects to your platform for the first time, it sends you the \u201credirect_uri\u201d next to some other query parameters such as: the scope, the state and the client_id.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how it looks:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>https:\/\/&lt;your_auth_platform_url&gt;?response_type=code&amp;client_id=&lt;CLIENT_ID&gt;&amp;redirect_uri=&lt;REDIRECT_URI&gt;&amp;scope=&amp;state=&lt;STATE_VALUE&gt;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>So you have to keep track of that state and return it back when you return the code in the redirect_uri.<br>\nSuch as:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>{REDIRECT_URI}?code={OPENAI_OAUTH_TOKEN}&amp;state={STATE_VALUE}<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>I hope it helps <img src=\"https:\/\/emoji.discourse-cdn.com\/twitter\/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><\/p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"\/u\/kevinpiac\">@kevinpiac<\/a> Thanks a lot for your helpful support, you made my day!!

We\u2019ll provide details on the criteria for payments as we get closer.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>To be listed in the GPT Store the custom GPT must be functional in some way for non-paying users\u2014either through limited features or for a limited time.<\/p>\n<p>Another tool I recommend is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.agenthost.ai\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">agenthost.ai<\/a> \u2014 it lets you add a paywall and set up limits for free users.

Completely blocking doesn\u2019t make sense but one can limit the usage of GPT and monetize on top of it by limiting the number of messages or limiting premium features<\/p>\n<p>It is probably a very bad idea to implement some type of monetization on top of OpenAI\u2019s platform at this point.<\/p>\n<p>OpenAI is planning a revenue sharing plan for builders, that should be the focus.<\/p>\n<p>In the first quarter of this year monetization will be launched for some users in the US, the rest we know nothing at all. In the end this does not make sense, because to access a gpt you need a paid subscription. So we just have to wait, and my statistics imply that for most of 2024 there will be no real monetization unless the competition pushes.<\/p>",

However, I am interested in determining if target ads are effective in generating traffic to our plugin.<\/p>\n<p>Where is your GPT, how can I find it?<\/p>\n<p>Maybe add an action that acts as a tracking pixel early in the chat session to track. Hard to do unless they allow pixels which I doubt.<\/p>\n<p>thank you, I was considering that. perhaps theres a way<\/p>\n<p>So I have done some studying of this. Here are a few thoughts<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Build in a CTA in the Instructions that encourages chatters to share the GPT after they use it. There are ways to do this subtly so as to not overly annoy the user but still drive that loop.<\/li>\n<li>Build your brand on whichever social media platform you love best and share GIFs or videos of you using the GPT<\/li>\n<li>\u201cancillary branding\u201d seems quite important. The <a href=\"https:\/\/suefel.com\/gpts\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GPTs that are getting 10,000+ views per day<\/a> are very good at creating animations, and a \u201cstory\u201d around their GPTs.<\/li>\n<li>Constantly evolving and improving the GPT each day drives a loyal following.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>It\u2019s early <a class=\"mention\" href=\"\/u\/jkrn0\">@jkrn0<\/a> , so keep at it and you will start driving steady organic traffic. You got this!<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for the info, can we confirm they are getting thousands is ln uses per day, those numbers seem high to me as if the developer on the site randomly generated those figures. As a plug-in developer<br>\n100 a day was normal. Regardless than you for the response as the ancillary idea seems worthwhile<\/p>\n<p>This post was flagged by the community and is temporarily hidden.<\/p>\n<p>Since the GPTs require a ChatGPT plus subscription to begin using, it\u2019s not a good choice to use Google ads. The people who come from the ads may not have the right to access your GPTs.<\/p>\n<p>I would not recommend <strong>paying<\/strong> for ads when you have no idea how much money you are going to make in total. I think a lot of developers perceive it as a gold mine but are going to be disappointed when they figure out that only two to three dozen people get to access the gold mine, where they only find small deposits every couple of weeks.<\/p>\n<p>Rather, one might end up doing the math, and find out that the monetization for being in the  tops of the leaderboards in engagements-per-month is just a small discount off of ChatGPT Plus dollars-per- month.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of it is going to come down to already having an existing audience. If you do, it\u2019ll be easier to get people to check it out and increase your stats.<\/p>\n<p>However, I\u2019m thinking that an extremely useful or \u201ccool\u201d Custom GPT might also take off on its own as the platform grows.<\/p>\n<p>Personally, I wouldn\u2019t pay $1\/click and not even know if they were chatting with it. Have you tried Facebook ads? I\u2019ve gotten those as cheap as $0.01\/click before\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Can you elaborate on this, you mean even top of gpt boards may not pay well<\/p>\n<p>Agree with this idea. GPTs navigation sites may be a good choice.<\/p>",

Building GPT involves many trials to put together API interactions and fine-tuning a prompt etc. It\u2019s a proper software development that requires plenty of debugging, so those 40 messages cap per 3 hours is laughable.<\/p>\n<p>I do see how complex each interaction can be on the OpenAI\u2019s end, but, then shouldn\u2019t be there a \u201cdebug\u201d mode when the GPT developer can have finer control during the development phase? I suppose it\u2019s hard to contain the abuse of the system then.<\/p>\n<p>Anyways, GPTs seem more like an \u201calpha\u201d rather than \u201cbeta\u201d, there are so many things to support proper development and I wish all the best to the team behind it!<\/p>\n<p>This frustration is not only when building.

Hence, I try to stick to vanilla ChatGPT GPT4, instead of custom GPTs (as useful some of them are).<\/p>\n<p>They are counting against the same cap for an account, so what\u2019s the difference you observe?<\/p>\n<p>So in general,  having used ChatGPT steadily for a year now my experience has been the following.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>There are \u201cflurries\u201d of this that happen every few months and can last for a week or two. In total I\u2019d say I\u2019ve spent about 5% of my time hitting the cap and 95% not. So it will go away.<\/li>\n<li>It is likely due to the new GPT functionality and how the Knowledge and Actions are interacting with the back end. Perhaps one response that uses Knowledge counts as \u201c2\u201d and a response that uses Knowledge and Actions counts as \u201c3\u201d. That may be off-base but it feels right given my experience.<\/li>\n<li>Switching to GPT-4 makes you less likely to hit the cap. Indeed there have been times where I hit the cap with a GPT and it still allowed me to start a new thread with GPT-4 (vanilla ChatGPT). For clarity, I have hit the cap with GPT Builder multiple times, opened a new window, and used vanilla GPT-4 and was not cap-restricted.<\/li>\n<li>Version 3.5 is actually quite powerful and not capped at all. You can\u2019t do everything you can with a GPT or GPT-4 but there is a lot you can do, and fast, with it. If you batch some other tasks and interact with 3.5 for a bit that can be a productive way to pass the downtime.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>It can be frustrating for sure.<\/p>\n<p>In general, I really like the idea from <a class=\"mention\" href=\"\/u\/former.token\">@former.token<\/a> and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"\/u\/_j\">@_j<\/a>  to make it easy for Custom GPT developers to request a higher cap, or make GPT creation \u201ccap free\u201d. It\u2019s a manual process anyway and is truly a developer workflow that takes cycles. Hopefully OpenAI can take notice of that request.<\/p>\n<p>All I need is guidance on how we can build while the current cap is so low.<\/p>\n<p>Oh well, the only way now is to plan it to extreme detail.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Debug your API separately with Postman, webhook.site, or anything your heart belongs to.<\/li>\n<li>Do all edge cases, remove authentication from GPT integration to make it easier.<\/li>\n<li>Spread your 40 messages as evenly as possible over your working hours. Plan for that cap disruption so you have to work on something while it\u2019s getting restored.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To be honest, this is an entirely new way to develop software, and the messages cap is the least problem you will encounter. My 25+ years of web app development do help quite a bit, but this is another tech leap.<\/p>\n<p>I sent 20 messages today, and got blocked for 3 hours! This is a very bad service, anyone know any better alternatives?<\/p>",

        "Replies":"<p>Welcome to the forum\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Creating a course about AI, chatbots, and related technologies like ChatGPT, its plugins, Bard, Midjourney, etc., is a fantastic idea! Here are some key components and topics that could add significant value to your course:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Fundamentals of AI and Machine Learning<\/strong>: Start with the basics of AI, machine learning algorithms, and how they have evolved. This sets a solid foundation for understanding more complex concepts.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Deep Dive into Specific Tools<\/strong>: Detailed modules on each tool (ChatGPT, Bard, Midjourney, etc.), covering their architecture, functionality, strengths, and limitations. Include practical demonstrations.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)<\/strong>: Since these tools are largely based on NLP, a comprehensive section on NLP concepts, techniques, and their applications in chatbots and AI writing would be valuable.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Development and Integration<\/strong>: Include practical tutorials on developing and integrating chatbots into various platforms. Cover coding aspects, API usage, and customization.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ethical Considerations and Bias in AI<\/strong>: Address the ethical implications of AI, including data privacy, bias in AI models, and responsible usage guidelines.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Business Applications<\/strong>: Discuss how businesses can leverage these tools for marketing, customer service, content creation, etc. Include case studies or interviews with businesses that have successfully implemented these technologies.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Creative Uses of AI<\/strong>: Explore how AI is used in creative fields like art, music, and writing. This can include a module on tools like Midjourney for artistic creations.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Future Trends and Research<\/strong>: Discuss the future trajectory of AI and chatbot technology, including emerging trends and ongoing research areas.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Community and Resources<\/strong>: Provide resources for continued learning, such as communities, forums, online resources, and recommended readings.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Hands-On Projects and Assignments<\/strong>: Encourage practical learning by including assignments, projects, and challenges that require students to use the tools and concepts taught in the course.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Guest Lectures and Expert Interviews<\/strong>: Feature talks or interviews with experts in the field of AI and machine learning to provide industry insights and professional perspectives.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Regulatory Landscape and Compliance<\/strong>: Cover the legal aspects, including data protection laws like GDPR and how they impact the development and deployment of AI tools.<\/li>\n<li><strong>User Experience Design for Chatbots<\/strong>: Teach about designing chatbots that are user-friendly and engaging, focusing on conversational UI\/UX design principles.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Scalability and Performance Optimization<\/strong>: Discuss how to scale these systems for handling large numbers of users and optimizing their performance.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Troubleshooting and Best Practices<\/strong>: Include common challenges and best practices in the development and maintenance of AI systems and chatbots.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>By covering these areas, your course can offer a comprehensive, practical, and ethical perspective on AI and chatbots, catering to a wide range of interests from technical development to business applications and creative uses.<\/p>\n<p>I might suggest teaching about the different methods of gathering text, the messiness of text, the disparate respositories from which text must be mined, the different formats and mediums that need to be dealt with (pdf, word, html, xml etc.). Without high-quality text, there are no high-quality LLM-based applications. Yet obtaining and verifying and cleaning and organizing and storing text is not straightforward at all. I think it\u2019s difficulty is often underestimated.<\/p>",

Therefore have just upgraded my free tier account to the paid option for GPT-4.0. Actually with doing that I assumed I would also get an access to the usage of API Keys. But it turned out, that I still need to do a separate payment for it, which I did for 5 dollars. Now I have paid in total 25 dollars for both of the services but interestingly I see that I have a limit of 23 dollars at my usage profile in platform.openai. Therefore I am a bit confused, do I have now 23 dollars worth of API tokens, if yes why it is not 25 and how does this payments are related?<\/p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!!<br>\nMerve<\/p>",

        "Question":"<p>Hi everyone!<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been diving into the world of ChatGPT plugin development, and I recently wanted to clarify how the <code>ai-plugin.json<\/code> file and OpenAPI spec are translated into the \u201cPrompt for ChatGPT\u201d that you can find in the \u201cplugin devtools\u201d section. I thought sharing my findings with the community would be helpful, as understanding this process can be crucial for optimizing your plugin\u2019s performance and user experience.<\/p>\n<p>Although the official documentation provides a good starting point, working through these examples helped me gain deeper insights into the conversion process.<\/p>\n<p>The ChatGPT Plugin Prompt is a dynamically generated Typescript pseudo-code that acts as an interface between ChatGPT and your plugin. The <code>ai-plugin.json<\/code> file and the OpenAPI specification are essential components.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a quick summary of my findings:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>description_for_model<\/code> property in the <code>ai-plugin.json<\/code> file offers the most space (up to 8,000 characters) for the plugin prompt. However, it\u2019s crucial to make the most of other properties from the OpenAPI spec to optimize the prompt output.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Each API endpoint defined in the OpenAPI spec includes two description properties that contribute to the plugin prompt. With each description being 200-300 characters long, properly utilizing these properties can significantly increase the available prompt space.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>The OpenAPI Path Description, if available, appears immediately before the type declaration in the dynamically generated pseudo-code namespace of the plugin prompt. If the Path Description is unavailable, the OpenAPI Summary is used instead.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Only descriptions specific to <em>request properties<\/em> are included in the plugin prompt. This approach is beneficial because it provides more prompt space per component, as each description can be 200-300 characters long.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I hope this information helps those working on ChatGPT plugins to better understand the conversion process and optimize their plugin prompts!<\/p>\n<p>For a more detailed explanation, examples, and the full write-up, check out my blog post:<\/p>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https:\/\/wfhbrian.com\/mastering-chatgpt-plugins-plugin-prompt-space\/\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/original\/3X\/d\/b\/db0c00f525a7c7007d0c22ed8bf0abc41b03a573.png\" class=\"site-icon\" data-dominant-color=\"87A650\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\">\n\n      <a href=\"https:\/\/wfhbrian.com\/mastering-chatgpt-plugins-plugin-prompt-space\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" title=\"11:31PM - 01 May 2023\">WFH Brian \u2013 1 May 23<\/a>\n  <\/header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690\/388;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/optimized\/3X\/8\/7\/87a577725be64627b9534a0bfac0e49f11f5feca_2_690x388.jpeg\" class=\"thumbnail\" data-dominant-color=\"40404B\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/optimized\/3X\/8\/7\/87a577725be64627b9534a0bfac0e49f11f5feca_2_690x388.jpeg, https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/optimized\/3X\/8\/7\/87a577725be64627b9534a0bfac0e49f11f5feca_2_1035x582.jpeg 1.5x, https:\/\/global.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/original\/3X\/8\/7\/87a577725be64627b9534a0bfac0e49f11f5feca.jpeg 2x\"><\/div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/wfhbrian.com\/mastering-chatgpt-plugins-plugin-prompt-space\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Mastering ChatGPT Plugins: Optimizing Prompt Space in the Dynamic Plugin...<\/a><\/h3>\n\n  <p>Optimizing the Plugin Prompt\u2014the generated interface that explains your plugin to ChatGPT\u2014can significantly enhance your ChatGPT plugin's performance.

        "Replies":"<p>Very useful! Thanks for sharing with us.<\/p>\n<p>Descriptions of response properties are ignored? I was hoping they were used.<\/p>\n<p>Likewise!

They might be worried that you are competing directly with their code interpreter, which they had been selectively opening up to people. While I\u2019m not a lawyer, I imagine this one is less likely considering that sounds pretty much like the same anti competitive practices that Microsoft was sued for back a while back.<\/p>\n<p>Another possible reason is that they have some serious concerns about AI with access to code execution and yours crosses a threshold they are uncomfortable with. And the last one I think could be plausible is that, like most environments that can execute user provided code, they are concerned with legal aspects of software from their side generating code that can be executed on your devices.<\/p>\n<p>Opens up a lot of legal problems for them.<\/p>\n<p>As for your examples, CodeCast only mentions \u201ccompiles your code\u201d they don\u2019t mention execute. I haven\u2019t used it though. CoderPad completes the code for you in an IDE, but I haven\u2019t seen anywhere that says it automatically executes the solution.<\/p>\n<p>The two existing ones make me think that maybe they want a human in the loop to overview and execute the code manually. I haven\u2019t used any of those though, so I could be off the mark. It could be they are comfortable executing code on their side automatically, but not other people doing that as a product\/service. Something to consider.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe you can find a similar solution\/compromise with your product\/service.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"haseeb_heaven\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"293526\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"><\/div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https:\/\/sea2.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/user_avatar\/community.openai.com\/haseeb_heaven\/48\/168803_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> haseeb_heaven:<\/div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Plugin Description : Lets you run and manage your code in 70+ coding languages.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/aside>\n<p>I\u2019m rereading the message from them, and it sounds like they might have an automatic GPT solution rejecting plugins. Maybe I\u2019m crazy and been talking to GPT too long, but the \u201cwe are currently unable to approve any plugins associated with managing and executing code\u201d sounds very GPT like.

        "Question":"<p>I\u2019m posting this in the community forum because 1) I don\u2019t use the public facing ChatGPT service so I\u2019m not a plugin user, and 2) this is purely my opinion on the value of plugins in-general based on my initial observations (and 9 years of building chat bots.)<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>If we think of plugins as the LLM equivalent of phone apps I think they can be made to work. An individual user needs to hand curate the plugins they use in much the same way you hand curate the apps installed on your phone. There will be 20 different plugins that know how to talk to a PDF so you can\u2019t just let the system pick one at random. The user needs to select their PDF plugin of choice.<\/li>\n<li>This promise being promoted that you can take any API and map it into a plugin by simply adding a manifest is just that a promise and a false one at that. Your plugin API needs to be hand crafted for whatever experience you\u2019re exposing to the user. Simple GET based API\u2019s might result in an ok experience but these models don\u2019t understand about multi-turn experiences where you need to collect more information before calling a given API. These 1st gen plugin experiences are exactly that. They\u2019re 1st gen. They have a long way to go to be what I would consider truly conversational.<\/li>\n<li>If we\u2019re thinking about plugins as being the chat equivalent of phone apps then what we should really be talking about are multi-turn agents, not plugins. You want to launch an interactive conversation with an Agent that you\u2019ve hand curated in the same way you hand curate the apps on your phone. Plugins aren\u2019t that experience. I\u2019m sorry, they\u2019re not\u2026<\/li>\n<\/ol>",
        "Replies":"<p>I guess what I\u2019m suggesting is that plugins are meh\u2026 And asking, can quickly move past the plugin phase of things and get on to Agents which can actually do useful shit for you?<\/p>\n<p>The only plugin that I am aware of that can access multiple apps is Zapier.  Not being a ChatGPT user either, but it does seem like you have to select, and then it talks to the plugin.  Maybe plugin power users can chime in here?<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m sure there are plans to scale the plugins to at least intelligently select what the user has \u201cinstalled\u201d.  If not , it should be on the Plugin roadmap!<\/p>\n<p>One thing I forgot to mention was the possibility of the Plugin API.  If they create it in a way that API users (like us) can intelligently decide which Plugin to send the data too, it could be awesome!  But yeah, just a stub off of ChatGPT makes it limiting for us API builders.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s less about the ability to call multiple plugins, and more the single turn nature of the current crop of plugins. That\u2019s going to fly for a minute or two. These plugins will need to be multi-turn to stick and then you\u2019re going to need support for features like interruption and everything we\u2019ve learned building alexa, google home,  siri, and cortana. The current approach isn\u2019t going to work for that. I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s just not.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"stevenic\" data-post=\"4\" data-topic=\"241795\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"><\/div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https:\/\/avatars.discourse-cdn.com\/v4\/letter\/s\/e480ec\/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> stevenic:<\/div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s less about the ability to call multiple plugins, and more the single turn nature of the current crop of plugins.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/aside>\n<p>Ok, so are you saying you can only send one thing to a plugin, and then you need to \u201cre-select\u201d it to sent it another thing?  Not sure I\u2019m following.<\/p>\n<p>Yes\u2026 Single turn is easy. You send the model a request, it maps the users intent to the appropriate plugin, you dispatch that intent. easy.<\/p>\n<p>Multi-turn is super hard. You need to start a conversation with a skill\/agent, and then for each turn of the conversation you need to remember the skill\/agent you\u2019re talking to. You need to know when the user is done talking to the skill\/agent, you need to track where the user is within the conversation with the skill\/agent (conversation history), you need to detect when the user wants to switch skills\/agents. Multi-turn is infinitely more complex.<\/p>\n<p>If you can send a request, and it maps users intent to the appropriate plugin, then why do I need a deeper history?<\/p>\n<p>This system is \u201cstateless\u201d, which is good right?  Why is state important here?  Just trying to understand.  What is a good reason why we need state?<\/p>\n<p>Lets use a concrete example\u2026 You want to book a flight from Denver to Seattle. You tell GPT, \u201cI want to book a flight from Denver to Seattle\u201d. It selects the \u201cBookFlight\u201d plugin. That plugin doesn\u2019t have enough information to go on so it needs to ask additional questions. It asks \u201cwhen do you want to leave?\u201d You don\u2019t want to direct the response to that at a different plugin so you you first need to remember you\u2019re in the middle of booking a flight and should direct future request to the BookFlight plugin. When do you stop forwarding messages to that plugin? You need to know when the conversation has ended so issue <span class=\"hashtag\">#1<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>Lets say the user then says, during the middle of booking a flight, \u201coh I\u2019m also going to need a car.\u201d That\u2019s not something the BookFlight plugin is going to understand how to do and is what we call an interruption. You need a mechanism for first detecting interruptions and then deferring them to be handled later. Modern chat bot frameworks support this but its non-trivial.<\/p>\n<p>These are all solvable issues but I don\u2019t see the current approaches to plugins as solving them. They\u2019re missing so many features that I don\u2019t know where to start with my critique.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"curt.kennedy\" data-post=\"7\" data-topic=\"241795\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"><\/div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https:\/\/sea2.discourse-cdn.com\/openai1\/user_avatar\/community.openai.com\/curt.kennedy\/48\/12122_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> curt.kennedy:<\/div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This system is \u201cstateless\u201d, which is good right?

It doesn\u2019t seem possible to me or at least in 9+ years I haven\u2019t worked out how to do it.<\/p>\n<p>Plugins, with very few exceptions are kinda trash.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest complaint I have though is there is no information associated with them.<\/p>\n<p>No documentation detailing how they can be used, no examples illustrating their benefits, zero information associated with any privacy policies or lack thereof.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no ability to sort, rate, review, hide, or filter plugins.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no indication which plugins you can use out of the box or which require a user account on the plugin site.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no information available about the plugin developer.<\/p>\n<p>Plugins are a great <em>idea<\/em> but without some stringent controls on the part of OpenAI they will become a desert of abundance.<\/p>\n<p>There will be so many pointless, narrow, single use plugins it will make it impossible for new, interesting, novel plugins to surface.<\/p>\n<p>All-in-all, I\u2019ve been extremely disappointed in plugins. We don\u2019t need seven different \u201cchat with your PDF plugins\u201d which all fail to meaningfully differentiate themselves and none of which can effectively, accurately, and reliably parse technical PDFs with equations, algorithms, tables, or plots.<\/p>\n<p>Nor do I see the utility of a plugin specifically for earthquake information in the Philippines.<\/p>\n<p>We certainly don\u2019t need 5+ real estate plugins built around individual websites (including one specifically for Ontario). Why not just have one plugin that aggregates all the sites so you don\u2019t need to? They\u2019re literally just recreating the search functionally on the real estate websites but worse.<\/p>\n<p>Nor do we need so many \u201cSEO\u201d plugins.<\/p>\n<p>The most problematic (and the ones most likely to land OpenAI in hot water) though are the investment related plugins. Honestly, I\u2019m shocked OpenAI hasn\u2019t put the kibosh on them.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"stevenic\" data-post=\"8\" data-topic=\"241795\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"><\/div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https:\/\/avatars.discourse-cdn.com\/v4\/letter\/s\/e480ec\/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> stevenic:<\/div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These are all solvable issues but I don\u2019t see the current approaches to plugins as solving them.

I\u2019m trying to solve it. But it\u2019s hard, the plugin ecosystem moves pretty slow these weeks. It\u2019s just time to learn what we have now, share what we see and wait until we get access to more capabilities\u2026<\/p>\n<p>You need to provide the model with its memory which is totally achievable\u2026 The way ChatGPT is calling plugins as stateless services isn\u2019t going to work. There are fundamental missing concepts. Adding a simple \u201cconversation id\u201d to the request would go a long way towards making things tractable but then you need memory to know on the calling side which plugin you\u2019re talking to and then the plugin needs to send GPT and \u201cEndOfConversation\u201d message to tell it when its done\u2026 Ironically, all the constructs needed to make this work exist but are being ignored.<\/p>\n<p>Again this is all just my 2 cents\u2026 This will work itself out over the long run.<\/p>\n<p>I mean, if plugin developers want to maintain state, I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be able to implement it.<\/p>\n<p>I imagine it would be as simple as building a key server into the API.<\/p>\n<p>When the model initial decides to trigger a call to the API, it checks if there is a conversation ID in context. If there isn\u2019t then the first call to the API requests an ID which would then be included in all future json strings sent to that API.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe I\u2019m under-thinking it or I have a fundamental misunderstanding of how ChatGPT is triggering plugins.<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know if having a conversation ID included in requests by default is the right solution as it eats up tokens unnecessarily for those plugins which don\u2019t require it.<\/p>\n<p>Let me give an example conversation flow and I\u2019ll leave to others to work out how the state and transfer of control should work. I have an opinion\u2026 This is a flow between a 2 agents; a TravelAgent, BookFlightAgent, and a User.<\/p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">TravelAgent: Hi how can I help you?\nUser: I need to book a flight to Denver next week for 3 days.\nBookFlightAgent: I can help with that so what day next week do you want to leave?\nUser: monday but I am also going to need a car\nTravelAgent: Sure, I can help you book a car once we get your flight booked.\nBookFlightAgent: So I have you leaving for Denver next Monday. Where are you flying from?\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>The user doesn\u2019t see the handoff happening between the various agents but this is a very believable conversation flow. There\u2019s a lot going on here\u2026<\/p>\n<p>The TravelAgent needs to interrupt the BookFlightAgent when the car is requested and then it needs to remember to pass control to the BookCarAgent once the BookFlightAgent is done.<\/p>\n<p>Also, after an interruption occurs the TravelAgent needs to pass control back to the BookFlightAgent so that it can re-prompt the user for the information its waiting on.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d just have the <code>TravelAgent<\/code> generate some UID in the first invocation, inject it into the context, and have the plugin include that UID in the json sent to the plugin API on each subsequent call.<\/p>\n<p>That would help you to remember the tasks you need to perform (we call this UID a ConversationID in the Bot Framework) but you still need mechanisms to pass control temporarily from the BookFlightAgent to the TravelAgent and then back. And you need a mechanism to know when the BookFlightAgent is finished.<\/p>\n<p>I have had (some) success with having a plugin return instructions for GPT to follow, and have implemented an agent using that model. Couldn\u2019t that solve some of <a class=\"mention\" href=\"\/u\/stevenic\">@stevenic<\/a> problems?<\/p>\n<p>Having said that, I basically just use my search plugin and little\/nothing else (well, ScholarAI).<\/p>\n<p>IMHO, the biggest problem with Plugins is that OpenAI wants to \u2018own\u2019 the user. As long as that is the case we have a problem. Hence I eagerly await the python port of alphawave (hi <a class=\"mention\" href=\"\/u\/stevenic\">@stevenic<\/a> <img src=\"https:\/\/emoji.discourse-cdn.com\/twitter\/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">), and will start working on a crude version of it myself after I get a couple of other things off my plate.<\/p>",

This is because the probability of a hallucination goes up quite a bit in these cases and you definitely don\u2019t want something that just sounds reasonable to be mixed with real answers.<\/p>\n<p>In these cases the prompt is something like \u201cIf no applicable knowledge is retrieved then reply with \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019\u201d.<br>\nIn your case you can try to adapt this prompt accordingly.<br>\nAnother way of doing it would be to set a threshold for the semantic similarity. If all results are below the threshold you return to the chat bot with the user question and the context but with another system prompt which simply excludes the external knowledge.<\/p>\n<p>The best approach may depend on the proportion of questions you expect to be answered from the knowledge base versus the proportion of questions requiring general knowledge.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>If using general knowledge will be relatively rare, you could try adding instructions like \u201cConsult the provided documents for your answer. If they are not helpful, you may base your answer on your own research.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If there will be a fairly even mix between the two kinds of answers, you could try adding instructions like \u201cThe provided documents may be helpful in writing your answer.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Two additional thoughts: 1. I would caution against using instructions like \u201cact like a basic chat model.\u201d Instead, pretend you are instructing students, i.e., \u201cfor your answer, you may use the textbook I\u2019ve provided or you may conduct your own research.\u201d 2. I am curious about your use case where a single application is built to answer questions from a knowledge base and from outside it. Might your users be confused about this and wonder whether some answers are more reliable than others? Without knowing about your use case, my gut reaction is that you may need two applications, not one.<\/p>",

Do you see something near the head of the file, that\u2019s where the problem is.<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think this is a server side error.<\/p>\n<p>that\u2019s not the issue. it\u2019s perfectly formatted using json LSP<\/p>\n<p>the json is formatted thats fine.<\/p>\n<p>But the file in which you have it, is that fine? does it contain BOM like others have mentioned?<\/p>\n<p>yeah that\u2019s not it david. there is nobomb in my json file<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re using ngrok you can inspect the requests and responses and see what is happening.<\/p>\n<p>When you run ngrok it should tell you how to access the web interface.<\/p>\n<p>Doukbke check that you can browse to the file as well.<\/p>\n<p>Saw a similar thread on this forum.<\/p>\n<p>You might also be facing a browser problem. Any chance you are using the brave browser?<\/p>\n<p>I have the same issue. Could it be that when OpenAI fetches the ai-plugin.json file through ngrok, the ngrok browser warning site is shown to ChatGPT instead of the manifest file? I think this would only be fixable if OpenAI adds the \u2018ngrok-skip-browser-warning\u2019 Header with any value in the call.<\/p>\n<p>Related on StackOverflow: questions\/73017353\/how-to-bypass-ngrok-browser-warning (I can\u2019t post links)<\/p>\n<p>I think if you create an ngrok account and then do:<\/p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">ngrok config add-authtoken XXXX\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>You can browse without any issues?<\/p>\n<p>Use the dev tools, inspect the packet and see what the request\/response is.<\/p>\n<p>I had a similar error when calling openai finetune API with curl. A work around I find is to use postman to call the same API and it worked.<\/p>\n<p>Yes this was it for me.  Had to buy an $10\/month account and regen ngrok url.<\/p>",

        "Question":"<p>Hey developers! For those who are struggling (especially beginners) with ChatGPT plugin development and find the official documentation lacking, I wrote a comprehensive tutorial on how to build a simple ChatGPT plugin. You can read it <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.to\/mmz001\/chatgpt-plugin-development-tutorial-4p4d\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In my tutorial, I\u2019ve outlined how you can structure your plugin for an improved developer experience. In particular, I show how you can leverage FastAPI\u2019s automatic OpenAPI schema generation for faster prototyping. For example, I explain how you can generate descriptions for your endpoints directly from your code\u2014no manual editing of the OpenAPI spec. I also go explain in-depth how you can install your localhost plugin in ChatGPT.<\/p>\n<p>I hope this tutorial is helpful for everyone! You can find the source code for the tutorial <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/mmz-001\/chatgpt-qr-code-plugin\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">here<\/a>.<\/p>",
