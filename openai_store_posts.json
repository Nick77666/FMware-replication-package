But not all. How?<br>\nWhen I search for one of my GPTs that IS public, it always shows at top. I assume that is specific to each individual. In other words, I have no way to know where it appears in search results for other users, just that it is always <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1<\/span> for me.<br>\nShould we pack our GPT name and description with lots of relevant keywords to get it to show up more? Use generic GPT names instead of unique ones?<\/p>",

        "Question":"<p>Hi OpenAI team,<\/p>\n<p>First off, congrats on the launch of the GPTs store. I think you guys did a great job simplifying what was originally intended in the mockups which is awesome.<\/p>\n<p>My one piece of feedback for the store is I think the discoverability of GPTs is lacking. What I mean by this specifically is currently, only the top 12 GPTs get shown but there are tons of great GPTs that most of us probably have no idea about unless they were directly shared with us. On the current implementation, they are essentially completely hidden which when monetization comes around, essentially is pointless for 99% of the store.<\/p>\n<p>As a suggestion, I would offer one of two things:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Simply show us all the GPTs on a different page per category. So for example, say I click on the writing category, I think it would be a simple improvement to have a \u201csee all\u201d button that shows all the GPTs in this category, instead of just 12. From there, you could filter through \u201cmost used\u201d, \u201cnew\u201d etc.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Add recommendations for users. This is of course much harder technically, but would make for a great experience for users. Say something like \u201cSince you used this GPT, you might like this\u201d. This down the road would be awesome.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I love the GPTs store concept and I\u2019d hate for it to get stuck over something like this which seems like a bit of a shortcoming currently. Happy to provide more feedback if wanted.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks again for the great work!<\/p>",

However, from an external viewpoint, for both developers and users, it seems more like a catastrophe.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, for humans, choosing between two options is already complex enough, let alone facing 300,000 alternatives. For developers, emerging victorious from a sea of 300,000 competitors is no small feat. In essence, to avoid being trampled in this crowd, it might be wiser to stay away.<\/p>\n<p>The shortest path often turns out to be the longest journey.

The way we access GPT shouldn\u2019t just be through a Store; it too is an entity.<\/p>\n<p>Users don\u2019t want to search for GPTs; they want to engage in conversation, not search.<\/p>\n<p>Developers are looking for more than just prompt engineering; they desire to harness the capabilities of ChatGPT.<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, I trust that OpenAI will find the right way to integrate these needs!<\/p>",

The aim of this GPT was to enhance the learning experience by generating educational summaries from user-submitted videos.<\/p>\n<p>This GPT, with over 5000+ chats, received positive feedback from users, some of whom were highly enthusiastic. It secured the 10th position in the Education category. During this period, I personally handled backend development, testing, user interactions, and user experience improvements. Additionally, I invested my funds in marketing and advertising for this GPT.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday, I was notified of its removal, without any clear explanation. The message vaguely suggested a potential violation of the Terms of Service or Usage Policies. Consequently, I meticulously reviewed these documents and amended any aspect that could potentially be in breach.<\/p>\n<p>Today, I received a second notice of removal, again without detailed reasoning, merely referencing the same documents I had already examined in depth. Even a lawyer friend of mine found no grounds for violation.<\/p>\n<p>When I received the second notice, I was outside and could only glimpse the message title on my phone, as the message wouldn\u2019t fully load. Later, at home, on my laptop, I discovered there was no detailed reason for the removal. Furthermore, I learned that reinstatement in the GPT Store was not an option, nor was there a way to appeal.<\/p>\n<p>My goal was to be a proactive developer, dedicating resources to development and advancing GPTs on the OpenAI GPT Store. This ambition is now unattainable if my projects are removed without specific justification.<\/p>\n<p>Dear Openai, if the decision is irreversible and not a technical error but a conscious choice, I implore you to enlighten me about any mistakes I may have made. I have earnestly sought clarity, even enlisting legal counsel for a thorough review, yet the reason for this decision remains elusive.<\/p>",

It was released last week and I still don\u2019t have access. I always receive updates after everyone else. Even my friend created a new account and gained access to the GPT store.

Really cool stuff: <a href=\"https:\/\/chat.openai.com\/g\/g-rbBEWcJaw-friendly-chat\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ChatGPT - Friendly Chat<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Also, does anyone know why the publish to everyone on the store is no longer an option? One of my gpt was on the store, I tried turning into everyone with a link and then everyone back but the option was gone, so its not that I have too many gpts on the store. Anyways, I hope this gpt is useful for someone, its something quite fun to use in my humble opinion!<\/p>",

We can no longer write. I think OpenAI talked to Apple to ban this kind of thing after it released its app.<\/p>\n<p>This is very bad.
