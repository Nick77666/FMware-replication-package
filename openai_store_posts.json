        "Question":"<p>Hi OpenAI team,<\/p>\n<p>First off, congrats on the launch of the GPTs store. I think you guys did a great job simplifying what was originally intended in the mockups which is awesome.<\/p>\n<p>My one piece of feedback for the store is I think the discoverability of GPTs is lacking. What I mean by this specifically is currently, only the top 12 GPTs get shown but there are tons of great GPTs that most of us probably have no idea about unless they were directly shared with us. On the current implementation, they are essentially completely hidden which when monetization comes around, essentially is pointless for 99% of the store.<\/p>\n<p>As a suggestion, I would offer one of two things:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Simply show us all the GPTs on a different page per category. So for example, say I click on the writing category, I think it would be a simple improvement to have a \u201csee all\u201d button that shows all the GPTs in this category, instead of just 12. From there, you could filter through \u201cmost used\u201d, \u201cnew\u201d etc.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Add recommendations for users. This is of course much harder technically, but would make for a great experience for users. Say something like \u201cSince you used this GPT, you might like this\u201d. This down the road would be awesome.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I love the GPTs store concept and I\u2019d hate for it to get stuck over something like this which seems like a bit of a shortcoming currently. Happy to provide more feedback if wanted.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks again for the great work!<\/p>",

However, from an external viewpoint, for both developers and users, it seems more like a catastrophe.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, for humans, choosing between two options is already complex enough, let alone facing 300,000 alternatives. For developers, emerging victorious from a sea of 300,000 competitors is no small feat. In essence, to avoid being trampled in this crowd, it might be wiser to stay away.<\/p>\n<p>The shortest path often turns out to be the longest journey.

The way we access GPT shouldn\u2019t just be through a Store; it too is an entity.<\/p>\n<p>Users don\u2019t want to search for GPTs; they want to engage in conversation, not search.<\/p>\n<p>Developers are looking for more than just prompt engineering; they desire to harness the capabilities of ChatGPT.<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, I trust that OpenAI will find the right way to integrate these needs!<\/p>",

This ambition is now unattainable if my projects are removed without specific justification.<\/p>\n<p>Dear Openai, if the decision is irreversible and not a technical error but a conscious choice, I implore you to enlighten me about any mistakes I may have made. I have earnestly sought clarity, even enlisting legal counsel for a thorough review, yet the reason for this decision remains elusive.<\/p>",

This store allows users to access over 3 million custom ChatGPT versions created by users and shared for public use.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Store Features<\/strong>: The store showcases a diverse range of GPTs developed by partners and the community. It includes a leaderboard with categories like DALL\u00b7E, writing, research, programming, education, and lifestyle. New featured GPTs will be highlighted weekly, including tools for trail recommendations, academic paper search, coding tutorials, design tools, book recommendations, and math and science tutoring.<\/li>\n<li><strong>GPT Submission Process<\/strong>: Users can build their own GPTs without coding skills and share them in the store. This requires saving the GPT for everyone and verifying the Builder Profile. GPTs must comply with usage policies and brand guidelines, and they undergo a review process for adherence to policies.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Revenue Program for Builders<\/strong>: A revenue program for GPT builders is planned, starting in the US. Builders will earn based on user engagement with their GPTs, with details to be provided later.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Team and Enterprise Features<\/strong>: The new ChatGPT Team plan offers access to a private section of the GPT Store with secure GPT publishing. Enhanced admin controls for Enterprise customers are also mentioned, including management of internal and external GPTs. Conversations with GPTs are not used to improve models in Team and Enterprise plans.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This summary captures the key developments and features of the new GPT Store, emphasizing its scope, user engagement, and compliance aspects.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<p>Looking forward to everybody\u2019s first experiences!<\/p>",

For this setup, I plan to require users to provide their own API keys as the only form of authentication.<\/p>\n<p>My question pertains to the financial aspect of this arrangement with OpenAI:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does OpenAI have a policy for sharing profits in scenarios where third-party applications like mine are used? i.e Will they provide x% of the revenue to the creator of the assistant_id generated by user_id?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Best,<br>\nAndy<\/p>",

But not all. How?<br>\nWhen I search for one of my GPTs that IS public, it always shows at top. I assume that is specific to each individual. In other words, I have no way to know where it appears in search results for other users, just that it is always <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1<\/span> for me.<br>\nShould we pack our GPT name and description with lots of relevant keywords to get it to show up more? Use generic GPT names instead of unique ones?<\/p>",

Has anyone here experienced a similar transition?
