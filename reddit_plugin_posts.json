        "Question":"Building a plugin for ChatGPT is like magic.\n\nYou give it a an OpenAPI schema with natural language description for the endpoints, and formats for requests and responses. Each time a user asks something, ChatPGT decides whether to use your plugin based on context, if it decides it's time to use the plugin it goes to the API, understands what endpoint it should use, what parameters it should fill in, sends a request, receives the data, processes it and informs the user of only what they need to know.  \ud83e\udd2f\n\nNot only that, for my plugin (creating shortened or custom edits of YouTube videos), it understands that it needs to first get the video transcript from one endpoint, understands what's going on in the video at each second, then makes another request to create the new shortened edit.\n\nIt also looks at the error code if there is one, and tries to resend the request differently in an attempt to fix the mistake!\n\nI have never imagined anything like this in my entire career. The potential and implications are boundless. It's both exciting and scary at the same time. Either way we're lucky to live through this.",

        "Title":"Is anyone scared of GPT plugins?",
        "Question":"I know there's been much debate about how ChatGPT and other LLMs will not replace knowledge economy jobs, but looking at the advancements in just the past 2 weeks alone is mind-blowing and scary. Specifically talking about GPT4 and Plugins. \n\nKnowledge workers' biggest strength is knowing arcane skills. Programming, marketing, design, sales, business etc. are skills that people spend years learning. But now with LLM plugins, you don't need to learn these skills as long as you can communicate with the LLM and have analytical skills to ask it meaningful questions.\n\nFor instance, you don't need to learn SQL, you can just ask a (hypothetical) plugin in plain English to fetch insights for you. Even different facets of product management can be automated. Writing PRDs, generating interview scripts for customer research, running the research, summarizing and synthesing the insights, feeding these insights to product frameworks to generate product strategy. Not saying that all of this is possible today, but given the trajectory these technologies are on, it should be possible in years, if not months.\n\nHonestly, this scares me. Yes, there are examples from the past about how technological innovations furthered human creativity and skills, but I'd love to get a glimpse of what the future looks like when potentially every human in the world can do any task without learning it but instead by knowing how to talk to an LLM and having bare minimum analytical skills.\n\nEDIT: Didn't realize this post would blow up! As few others have pointed out, my goal was not to create fear mongering with AI taking our jobs, and apologies if it came across that way. \n\nI am loving the discussions and examples that people have shared from various facets of their lives trying to use ChatGPT to uplevel their skills. Thank you for sharing! \n\nAt the same time, for those of you that are dismissing LLMs as a stochastic parrot or the impact it will have to global economy, here's a reference that might make you think otherwise.

However, Browsing mode has used Bing for running searches since day 1. Maybe it's a deeper integration than just the Bing Search API?\r  \n\r  \nFrom the ChatGPT plugins announcement back in March:\r  \n\r  \n\"Browsing retrieves content from the web using the Bing search API. As a result, we inherit substantial work from Microsoft on (1) source reliability and truthfulness of information and (2) \u201csafe-mode\u201d to prevent the retrieval of problematic content. The plugin operates within an isolated service, so ChatGPT\u2019s browsing activities are separated from the rest of our infrastructure.\"\r  \n\r  \nhttps:\/\/openai.com\/blog\/chatgpt-plugins",
