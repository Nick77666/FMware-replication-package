        "Question":"Building a plugin for ChatGPT is like magic.\n\nYou give it a an OpenAPI schema with natural language description for the endpoints, and formats for requests and responses. Each time a user asks something, ChatPGT decides whether to use your plugin based on context, if it decides it's time to use the plugin it goes to the API, understands what endpoint it should use, what parameters it should fill in, sends a request, receives the data, processes it and informs the user of only what they need to know.  \ud83e\udd2f\n\nNot only that, for my plugin (creating shortened or custom edits of YouTube videos), it understands that it needs to first get the video transcript from one endpoint, understands what's going on in the video at each second, then makes another request to create the new shortened edit.\n\nIt also looks at the error code if there is one, and tries to resend the request differently in an attempt to fix the mistake!\n\nI have never imagined anything like this in my entire career. The potential and implications are boundless. It's both exciting and scary at the same time. Either way we're lucky to live through this.",

        "Title":"Is anyone scared of GPT plugins?",
        "Question":"I know there's been much debate about how ChatGPT and other LLMs will not replace knowledge economy jobs, but looking at the advancements in just the past 2 weeks alone is mind-blowing and scary. Specifically talking about GPT4 and Plugins. \n\nKnowledge workers' biggest strength is knowing arcane skills. Programming, marketing, design, sales, business etc. are skills that people spend years learning. But now with LLM plugins, you don't need to learn these skills as long as you can communicate with the LLM and have analytical skills to ask it meaningful questions.\n\nFor instance, you don't need to learn SQL, you can just ask a (hypothetical) plugin in plain English to fetch insights for you. Even different facets of product management can be automated. Writing PRDs, generating interview scripts for customer research, running the research, summarizing and synthesing the insights, feeding these insights to product frameworks to generate product strategy. Not saying that all of this is possible today, but given the trajectory these technologies are on, it should be possible in years, if not months.\n\nHonestly, this scares me. Yes, there are examples from the past about how technological innovations furthered human creativity and skills, but I'd love to get a glimpse of what the future looks like when potentially every human in the world can do any task without learning it but instead by knowing how to talk to an LLM and having bare minimum analytical skills.\n\nEDIT: Didn't realize this post would blow up! As few others have pointed out, my goal was not to create fear mongering with AI taking our jobs, and apologies if it came across that way. \n\nI am loving the discussions and examples that people have shared from various facets of their lives trying to use ChatGPT to uplevel their skills. Thank you for sharing! \n\nAt the same time, for those of you that are dismissing LLMs as a stochastic parrot or the impact it will have to global economy, here's a reference that might make you think otherwise.

However, Browsing mode has used Bing for running searches since day 1. Maybe it's a deeper integration than just the Bing Search API?\r  \n\r  \nFrom the ChatGPT plugins announcement back in March:\r  \n\r  \n\"Browsing retrieves content from the web using the Bing search API. As a result, we inherit substantial work from Microsoft on (1) source reliability and truthfulness of information and (2) \u201csafe-mode\u201d to prevent the retrieval of problematic content. The plugin operates within an isolated service, so ChatGPT\u2019s browsing activities are separated from the rest of our infrastructure.\"\r  \n\r  \nhttps:\/\/openai.com\/blog\/chatgpt-plugins",

Establece al pais como plurinacional?\n\n**Respuesta:**\n\nLa propuesta de nueva Constituci\u00f3n reconoce a los pueblos ind\u00edgenas como parte de la Naci\u00f3n chilena, la cual es descrita como \"una e indivisible\". El Estado se compromete a respetar y promover los derechos individuales y colectivos de los pueblos ind\u00edgenas garantizados por la Constituci\u00f3n, las leyes y los tratados internacionales ratificados por Chile y que se encuentren vigentes. Adem\u00e1s, se reconoce la interculturalidad como un valor de la diversidad \u00e9tnica y cultural del pa\u00eds y se promueve el di\u00e1logo intercultural en condiciones de igualdad y respeto rec\u00edprocos (P\u00e1gina 5).\n\nEn cuanto a la participaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica, la ley podr\u00e1 establecer mecanismos para promover la participaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica de los pueblos ind\u00edgenas en el Congreso Nacional (P\u00e1ginas 57-58).\n\nEstos extractos indican que, aunque se reconoce la importancia de los pueblos ind\u00edgenas y su cultura dentro de la naci\u00f3n, la propuesta de Constituci\u00f3n no establece a Chile como un Estado plurinacional. En cambio, se enfatiza la unidad e indivisibilidad de la naci\u00f3n, al tiempo que se garantiza el respeto y la promoci\u00f3n de los derechos de los pueblos ind\u00edgenas dentro de ese marco unitario.\n\n**Pregunta 2:**\n\n# Que dice respecto a la vida del que est\u00e1 por nacer, como funciona eso con la ley de aborto actual en Chile y como se diferencia de la constituci\u00f3n actual?\n\n**Respuesta:**\n\nLa propuesta de nueva Constituci\u00f3n no menciona expl\u00edcitamente la protecci\u00f3n del que est\u00e1 por nacer en los fragmentos proporcionados por la b\u00fasqueda. Sin embargo, se hace referencia a la obligaci\u00f3n del Estado de respetar y considerar los tratados de derechos humanos ratificados por Chile y que se encuentren vigentes (P\u00e1gina 4-5). Esto podr\u00eda incluir tratados internacionales que aborden la protecci\u00f3n de la vida desde la concepci\u00f3n o el derecho a la vida en general.\n\nEn cuanto a la ley de aborto actual en Chile, la propuesta de Constituci\u00f3n no parece entrar en conflicto directo con ella, ya que no se menciona una protecci\u00f3n espec\u00edfica del que est\u00e1 por nacer que pudiera anular o modificar la legislaci\u00f3n vigente sobre el aborto. La ley actual en Chile permite el aborto bajo tres causales: riesgo de vida de la mujer, inviabilidad fetal y en caso de violaci\u00f3n.\n\nLa diferencia con la Constituci\u00f3n actual de Chile radica en que la Constituci\u00f3n vigente hasta la fecha de mi \u00faltima actualizaci\u00f3n (abril de 2023) establece en su Art\u00edculo 19, N\u00famero 1, la protecci\u00f3n a la vida del que est\u00e1 por nacer. Cualquier cambio en esta disposici\u00f3n o su interpretaci\u00f3n depender\u00eda del texto final de la nueva Constituci\u00f3n y de c\u00f3mo se relaciona con las leyes existentes, incluida la ley de aborto.\n\nPara obtener una respuesta definitiva sobre c\u00f3mo la propuesta de nueva Constituci\u00f3n se relaciona con la ley de aborto actual y c\u00f3mo se diferencia de la Constituci\u00f3n actual en este aspecto, ser\u00eda necesario realizar un an\u00e1lisis m\u00e1s detallado del texto completo de la propuesta y de las leyes pertinentes.\n\n**Pregunta 3:**\n\n# Como experto abogado constitucionalista, cual es la diferencia pr\u00e1ctica entre que diga \"del que est\u00e1 por nacer\" y \"de quien est\u00e1 por nacer\"?\n\n**Respuesta:**\n\nComo experto en derecho constitucional, puedo explicar que la diferencia entre las frases \"del que est\u00e1 por nacer\" y \"de quien est\u00e1 por nacer\" puede parecer sutil, pero tiene implicaciones significativas en t\u00e9rminos legales y filos\u00f3ficos, especialmente en el contexto del debate sobre el aborto y los derechos del feto.\n\n1. **\"Del que est\u00e1 por nacer\"**:\n\n* Esta frase es t\u00edpicamente utilizada para referirse al feto de una manera m\u00e1s impersonal o neutral, sin asignarle un estatus jur\u00eddico de \"persona\".\n* En algunos sistemas jur\u00eddicos, esta formulaci\u00f3n se ha utilizado para reconocer ciertos derechos del feto, como el derecho a la vida o a la protecci\u00f3n, pero sin equipararlo completamente con los derechos de una persona nacida.\n* Puede implicar la protecci\u00f3n de intereses potenciales o futuros que se materializar\u00e1n una vez que el feto nazca.\n\n1. **\"De quien est\u00e1 por nacer\"**:\n\n* Esta frase puede interpretarse como una personificaci\u00f3n del feto, al utilizar \"quien\", que generalmente se refiere a una persona.\n* Podr\u00eda sugerir un reconocimiento m\u00e1s fuerte de la agencia o la personalidad del feto, lo que podr\u00eda tener implicaciones en la atribuci\u00f3n de derechos completos o en la consideraci\u00f3n del feto como sujeto de derechos.\n* En algunos contextos, esta formulaci\u00f3n podr\u00eda usarse para argumentar en favor de un estatus jur\u00eddico m\u00e1s robusto para el feto, similar al de una persona nacida.\n\nEn la pr\u00e1ctica, la elecci\u00f3n de palabras puede reflejar la posici\u00f3n filos\u00f3fica o legal de un pa\u00eds o una cultura sobre cu\u00e1ndo comienza la vida y qu\u00e9 protecciones legales se deben otorgar al feto. En el contexto de la legislaci\u00f3n sobre el aborto, estas diferencias pueden influir en la interpretaci\u00f3n de las leyes y en las decisiones judiciales relacionadas con los derechos reproductivos y la protecci\u00f3n de la vida prenatal.\n\nEs importante se\u00f1alar que la interpretaci\u00f3n de estas frases puede variar significativamente seg\u00fan la jurisdicci\u00f3n y el contexto legal espec\u00edfico en el que se utilicen. Adem\u00e1s, la redacci\u00f3n de las constituciones y las leyes a menudo es objeto de intenso debate y an\u00e1lisis, ya que las palabras elegidas establecen las bases para la interpretaci\u00f3n y aplicaci\u00f3n de los derechos y deberes legales.\n\n**Pregunta 4:**\n\n# En la nueva propuesta dice \"de quien est\u00e1 por nacer\" esto no choca con la ley de aborto y derechos humanos?\n\n**Respuesta:**\n\nLa frase \"de quien est\u00e1 por nacer\" en una constituci\u00f3n o en cualquier documento legal puede ser interpretada como una personificaci\u00f3n del no nacido, lo que podr\u00eda sugerir un reconocimiento de ciertos derechos desde la concepci\u00f3n o en alg\u00fan punto antes del nacimiento. Si una constituci\u00f3n adopta esta fraseolog\u00eda, podr\u00eda interpretarse como un intento de otorgar un estatus jur\u00eddico al no nacido que se acerca al de una persona nacida.\n\nEn el contexto de la ley de aborto y los derechos humanos, si una nueva propuesta constitucional utiliza la frase \"de quien est\u00e1 por nacer\", esto podr\u00eda potencialmente entrar en conflicto con las leyes de aborto existentes que permiten el aborto bajo ciertas circunstancias. Esto depender\u00e1 de c\u00f3mo se interprete la frase en la pr\u00e1ctica jur\u00eddica y de si se considera que confiere derechos que podr\u00edan restringir o prohibir el aborto.\n\nEn Chile, la ley actual de aborto permite la interrupci\u00f3n del embarazo bajo tres causales espec\u00edficas. Si la nueva propuesta constitucional se interpreta como una protecci\u00f3n m\u00e1s fuerte de los derechos del no nacido, podr\u00eda haber un conflicto legal que requerir\u00eda resoluci\u00f3n, posiblemente a trav\u00e9s de una decisi\u00f3n judicial o una reforma legislativa para alinear la ley de aborto con la nueva constituci\u00f3n.\n\nEs importante tener en cuenta que la interpretaci\u00f3n de las disposiciones constitucionales no es est\u00e1tica y puede evolucionar con el tiempo a trav\u00e9s de la jurisprudencia y la pr\u00e1ctica legal. Adem\u00e1s, las constituciones a menudo contienen cl\u00e1usulas que permiten cierta flexibilidad en su aplicaci\u00f3n, y los tribunales pueden equilibrar los derechos en conflicto (como el derecho a la vida y los derechos reproductivos de la mujer) al tomar decisiones.\n\nEn resumen, la redacci\u00f3n de la nueva propuesta constitucional podr\u00eda tener implicaciones significativas para la ley de aborto y los derechos humanos en Chile, y cualquier conflicto percibido entre la constituci\u00f3n y la ley de aborto tendr\u00eda que ser resuelto dentro del marco legal y judicial del pa\u00eds.\n\n\\- - -\n\nLos leo.\n\nEdit: Typo.",

        "Question":"\u200cI've been on a mission to find the most efficient way to browse the Internet using chat GPT. I've tested numerous plugins to determine the best, and currently, VoxScript seems to be in the lead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI issued the same prompt to chat GPT, changing the activated plugin each time. The information I was seeking was the capitalization of the French company Bouygues. The prompt I used was: \"By searching for information on the Internet and using your knowledge, make a diagram of the capital distribution of the Bouygues company.\"\n\nFrom what I've observed, it's crucial that the plugins have two search phases. The first phase involves scanning the previews of numerous pages, and the second phase involves specifically opening one or two complete pages if possible.\n\nFor instance, the [keymat.ai](https:\/\/keymat.ai) plugin opens the first three links from the Google query and forms a response based on the information in these three links. Linkreader, on the other hand, searches the previews of the first five Google links and then opens one of the five links.\n\nVoxScript scans the previews of the top 20 Google results and opens only one page among the 20. In my trial, this was the strategy that provided the most accurate results, closely matching the reality I found manually searching on Google.\n\nI believe there are two features that should be integrated into current plugins:\n\n\\-> A self-critique function to judge the quality of the results provided.\n\n\\-> A function to loop back with a new Google query until the provided results are of satisfactory quality.\n\nI look forward to hearing your thoughts and experiences with these plugins.  \n\u200c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[VoxScript and Show me Diagrams](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hefggr54hwab1.png?width=195&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d8a438bbf844e548676a11695f66ddeaf978098)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Keymate.AI and Show Me diagrams](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3jl6j8x7hwab1.png?width=195&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e782d98bd600b7f6f7d66e91f462fedf04281cb)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[LInkReader and Show Me diagrams](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yiox47vbhwab1.png?width=195&format=png&auto=webp&s=904cfb794b1c65eff676563537d7c79c9a194a78)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Official website](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/noq784nrhwab1.png?width=322&format=png&auto=webp&s=0708402ad11ae81113badf6cee63400d675ec795)\n\n&#x200B;",

This free tool is revolutionizing the way we capture and cultivate complex ideas in ChatGPT.\n\nConceptmap stands out from the crowd. It's not just a mind-mapping utility; it's an evolving ecosystem of your thoughts and ideas. Starting from a central theme, it branches out into four key aspects, with the ability to expand further into detailed sub-nodes. This approach ensures that your brainstorming is not only captured but also organized in a way that reflects the natural flow of ideas.\n\nThe real magic happens with the integration of Conceptmap and ChatGPT, powered by the advanced GPT-4 engine. This combination brings you the structured visualization of Conceptmap with the intelligent, conversational engagement of ChatGPT. \ud83e\udde9\ud83e\udd16\n\nBut there's more \u2013 Conceptmap serves as a persistent, cross-chat memory for your conversations with ChatGPT.

While I still think these platforms have a way to go, I can absolutely see the disruptive potential they are going to provide to society, I believe it will have the greatest impact on society since the proliferation of the internet.\n\nOkay, with that said, there are some major limitations and some things I don't understand. Firstly, I have been using the paid subscription for a month and recently tried out plugins for the first time today. I went through and just downloaded a bunch that looked interesting. I did a couple prompts using what felt like 5 different plugins and before I knew it, it had locked me out, saying I reached the maximum limitation of 50 responses? Is this really where it caps people out? is there a way around this? It felt like I had barely used it and didn't seem like it was worth it at all if I had such a short amount of time to even figure out what the F was going on. \n\nSecondly, I thought of a good use case to potentially use this for, I started an accounting\/bookkeeping firm, and I was wondering if there was a way to utilize a plugin that would browse social media or other local forums where people would post for help looking for bookkeepers for example. That would be really powerful and useful for me and I would pay a lot of money for something like that. Anyway, cool stuff all around.",

        "Title":"GPTs must mean the end of ChatGPT plugins, surely, when they are this powerful?",
        "Question":"Since ChatGPT was first launched I kept thinking how powerful it would be with web browsing and API connectivity. Then we got Browse with Bing, followed by plugins, Code Interpreter (Advanced Data Analysis), Dall-E 3 integration, vision, amazing! But they were all separate, which was a massive limitation. Now we have GPTs, Assistants, etc.\n\nSeveral months back I created a WordPress plugin to integrate with OpenAI for creating SEO-optimised content (if interested you can [see this here](https:\/\/en-gb.wordpress.org\/plugins\/ai-scribe-the-chatgpt-powered-seo-content-creation-wizard\/)). It took a good couple of months to develop and probably the same amount of time to get approved due to the strict quality controls and coding standards adopted by WordPress's moderation team.\n\nWhen ChatGPT plugins came out, I wanted to re-create my WordPress plugin for ChatGPT but had no idea how to create one or the limitations\/possibilities of what I could do with them. With limited time to learn about them, I gave up on the idea.\n\nThen a few days back I managed to start testing GPTs. Being early days, the experience has been a bit flaky I guess due to the massive number of users jumping on board and overloading the system, but it only took me 2 minutes to realise the potential and see how easy they were to use.\n\nThe magic is that for the first time GPTs, we can do everything in one place - web browsing, advanced data analysis, image generation, and the ability to upload documents\/knowledge, etc. I wanted to put all of these features to the test and recreate my WordPress plugin.\n\nIt took about 20 minutes to create and test, then possibly another 20 mins tweaking. Compare this to the couple of months it took to create the WordPress plugin....\n\nWhat's even more amazing is that (unlike the WordPress plugin), it can generate images, real-time data, charts, etc. and embed all of this into an MS Word document with a downloadable link.\n\nIt really is amazing, you can [see the video demo](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nA-rubbY30o) and screenshots below. ChatGPT was running slower than normal today so the video is about 15 mins end to end, but usually the process would be completed in less than 10, which I expect it will get faster as OpenAI release newer, more efficient models.\n\nFor ChatGPT Plus users, the GPT can be found here: \n\n[https:\/\/chat.openai.com\/g\/g-ZTkBnCIbA-gpt-seo-article-creator-ai-scribe](https:\/\/chat.openai.com\/g\/g-ZTkBnCIbA-gpt-seo-article-creator-ai-scribe)\n\nScreenshots of the final downloadable article in MS Word:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/eigjuu3gf30c1.png?width=1902&format=png&auto=webp&s=27520271c5e182d6b2b018d3f5c6c3364177a2f4\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/c58gr34hf30c1.png?width=1258&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6b98adf098b4e0820046b8264c20dad11902045\n\nAll I wonder now, is what infrastructure they\u2019ll build behind these to allow them to become public, rated\/ranked, accessible, potentially monetised, etc.\n\nI honestly thought plugins were great, but it really felt as though they released plugins without thinking things through.\n\nHopefully, OpenAI will address all of those issues with GPTs and put a proper infrastructure in place, similar to what we have with other software marketplaces\/stores.\n\nDo you think GPTs will replace plugins or do they have a roll side-by-side? Share any of your own examples as I would love to see what innovations people are coming up with.",

On the other hand, Langchain requires indexing a large dataset and retraining the model on that dataset. From what I've read Langchina requires a lot of work and tweaking to get it good. \n\nWhat is the future of commercial LLM use cases? Do you think organizations are looking to use GPT4 with their own private plugins or are they going to training models with Langchain (or something like it)? What are the pros and cons of each?",

Despite all the excitement surrounding plugins, I rarely find myself using them. \n\nAnd tbh the few times that I've used them, the only one I found useful was Wolfram. The rest was so-so, including the web browsing one (though I don't have access to Code Interpreter yet).\n\nSo was wondering, is anyone using plugins regularly? If so, which one, and what for?",

        "Title":"PulsarChat - ChatGPT Plugins for Everyone!",
        "Question":"\nImagine asking ChatGPT to extract the key points from a 2-hour long podcast instead of sitting through the whole thing. This can save hours of your daily time.\n\nPlugins allow you to do exactly that! In simple terms it's an App Store for ChatGPT, it allows ChatGPT to access Google, summarize YouTube videos, and more... Yet, it is behind a 20$\/month subscription. Most people haven\u2019t even got to see how useful it is until now...\n  \n**Introducing PulsarChat**\n\nNow you can access 250+ ChatGPT plugins using PulsarChat for free! Not only that... you can create your own plugins with our plugin creator.\n\nPulsarChat works with your OpenAI API key, so you only pay to OpenAI for what you use. For an average user, this is 10x cheaper than paying 20$ *every* month with ChatGPT Plus subscription (they charge even if you didn\u2019t use it!)\n\n**How it works**\n\n- Get your OpenAI API Key (If you don't know how, stick till the end, I'll explain.)\n- Enter the key in PulsarChat\n- Start Chatting with Plugins!\n\n**Secure and Private**\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling paranoid about entering your API key on PulsarChat, know that your API key never leaves your browser!\n\nAll the messages you send go straight to OpenAI's servers and are only saved in your browser, nowhere else. Our website only tracks how often a feature is used to help me make that feature better. You don\u2019t need to believe my words, you can open your browser inspect tools, and verify my claims.\n\n**BONUS:** According to OpenAI's [data privacy policy](https:\/\/openai.com\/enterprise-privacy), they don\u2019t use your chat logs for training their AI models if you're accessing ChatGPT with an API Key.\n\nPulsarChat is not just ChatGPT+Plugins though, it is so MUCH more!\n\n**Prompts Library**\n\nYou already know what prompts are, they're specific instructions given to ChatGPT on how it should think and respond. PulsarChat has a collection of 1600+ high-quality prompts in our prompts library for you to use, with the ability to create one on your own.\n\n**System Prompts Library (AI Characters)**\n\nImagine being able to chat with an expert on your favorite subject and learn directly from them. It is now possible with our System Prompts feature! They're special prompts that change the entire behavior of ChatGPT for the chat session.\n\nAnd PulsarChat comes with a library of 140+ System Prompts, with the ability to create one on your own. So you can learn faster and be more productive than ever before!\n\n**Password Protected Chats**\n\nI have already told you how PulsarChat is secure and private, add password-protected chats to that list! Yes, you can set individual passwords for your chat sessions. When you set a password, PulsarChat encrypts the conversations with the industry standard secure *AES-256 encryption algorithm* every time it saves them.\n\n**And a lot more features!**\n\n- Imagine for example, you want to summarize a 2-hour-long Lex Friedman podcast, but it's too long for AI's default memory size of 4K tokens. But with PulsarChat you can achieve this with *bigger models* (16K and 32K context sizes) with no problem at all!\n\n- You can *edit any message* and steer the conversation in the direction you want. For example, you can edit AI's reply with your text and ask it to continue the conversation.\n\n- You change how the interface looks with *19 supported themes!*\n\n**What\u2019s the Catch?**\n\nPulsarChat is free, but some of the features have limited access. To use it without any limitations, you have to buy a license key. I\u2019m planning to launch PulsarChat at a price of 69$ for lifetime use but\u2026\n\nIf you buy now, you can get it at a discounted price of 39$ only. It\u2019s a lifetime deal (buy once and you can use it as long as the product exists!). Now compare this to ChatGPT's 240$\/year subscription, I should honestly charge more!\n\nStill not convinced? Although you can already try the product for free and decide, I\u2019m also offering you a 21-day money-back guarantee so you really have nothing to lose here.\n\nOK, enough of my TED talk...\nTry PulsarChat by visiting [PulsarChat.com](https:\/\/pulsarchat.com\/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=social_media&utm_content=sideproject) and clicking \u201cTry it now\u201d, or directly visit [chat.pulsarchat.com](https:\/\/chat.pulsarchat.com\/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=social_media&utm_content=sideproject)\n\n**PS:** If you don't have an OpenAI API Key follow the steps described [here](https:\/\/www.maisieai.com\/help\/how-to-get-an-openai-api-key-for-chatgpt).",
