        "Question":"As the post title says, I don't get it. Don't get me wrong, it's cool that people can now share \"their\" GPTs, but what is the real value here? It's not like people are spending buckets of money and literally training new transformers with original data for some purpose that they can then resell. It's just the same old GPT-4 with someone else's custom instructions slapped on it.\n\nI struggle to see the value here when it's something that I can so dramatically easily recreate. For example, the top coding GPT is \"Grimoire\" -- but it literally gives all the same answers and suggestions as my own coding GPT that I created. Except I like my own better because I can fine tune its responses to be bespoke to my style, whereas with \"Grimoire\" I am stuck with someone else's instructions that ask me to tip its creator. Yet both are sitting on top of the same knowledge set. I understand you can upload files, but that's not the same as fully training.\n\nIs it cool that people can share these? Yes. But given they're calling it a \"store\" (I haven't seen anything asking to pay yet) -- is someone going to have such good custom instructions on a GPT that I'm going to pay for it? No.\n\nI guess where I could be proven wrong is that not everyone wants to spend time creating their own GPT. But it really is so incredibly easy.\n\nThis is just my opinion. I am curious what others think.",

        "Question":"I think many of us had assumed OpenAI might offer developers the option of monetizing GPTs or  with paid subscriptions. Though with their recent announcements of \u201cengagement based revenue\u201d it seems possible that they\u2019ve decided against it for some reason.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to say. But, if I were to speculate as to why OpenAI might opt for engagement-based monetization over than subscription-based, here are a few reasons:\n\nGPTs already support oAuth. That means, if devs really want to make subscription-based GPTs, they already can  - so long as they provide the infrastructure. If devs host their own APIs, oauth provider service, and handle user\/subscription management, they can easily integrate it into their GPTs, without even having to give OpenAI a cut.\n\nOptics wise, This makes the ChatGPT seem more valuable to developers of more complex apps - and consumers.\n\nFor consumers, it\u2019s nice seeing the entire GPT store without prices next to every GPT. And for complex app devs, it\u2019s nice cause OpenAI isn\u2019t demanding a cut of your subscription revenues like the Apple App Store does.\n\nAnother reason is the lack of any technical mote - literally any company could launch a competing GPT store, taking a lower cut, and attract those developers. Sure, OpenAI has the GPT store market share - but again, they might want to cannibalise their consumers optics for the benefit of developers of low-effort GPTs. Apple and Google are only able to maintain a pseudo-monopoly on app stores because they control the hardware and software. OpenAI doesn\u2019t have that luxury, so it would quickly become a race to the bottom of who\u2019s willing to charge developers the smallest cut.\n\nLastly, this approach allows OpenAI to continue allocating their resources to R&D, instead of developing and supporting a multi-sided marketplace - which frankly, doesn\u2019t really align with the companies stated vision.\n\nSo I can understand why OpenAI might opt for an engagement based model. The developers still have freedom to have subscriptions, third party GPT stores won\u2019t have much leverage to lure developers away, pro users feel like they\u2019re getting a good value and not being taken advantage of with over-commercialized gpt store, and that will continue to attract more Pro users.\n\nAgain, we don\u2019t know exactly what OpenAIs monetization options look like yet - so it\u2019s all speculation.\n\nCurious if y\u2019all have any thoughts on this.",

I have a feeling that the better analogy is a Spotify type subscription platform. Millions of interchangeable, easy to make GPTs. The vast majority of them will be free with the $20\/m Plus subscription.\n\nThere will be paid GPTs, but not many people will buy them. Of course, a few hits will sell big numbers. Overall the store will be: 1. Great for the users. 2. Wonderful for OpenAI. 3. Better than nothing for the most new \u201cGPTs developers\u201d.\n\nJust like the vast majority of the musicians in Spotify make pennies from streaming. The same will be with the vast majority of the GPT developers. Most developers will publish quality GPTs and use them as a free lead magnet to monetize in other ways. (Like selling concert tickets and merch.)\n\nSome will make good money(but nothing big) from the revenue share when their GPTs go viral. They will flex it hard on social: \u201cI make $10K a month with CustomGPTs!\u201d Many others will show you \u201chow to make the 10K\u201d, even though they have made $5 with it.\n\nAnd Sam will come on the stage and say:\n\n* People love building and sharing customGPTs.\n* Many of them also make good money with our revenue share.\n* The Plus subscriber numbers have grown substantially.\n* Everything is mouth to mouth. We\u2019ve spent $0 on marketing.\n* It\u2019s a beautiful technology.",

You all are the best!\\*\\*\n\n\\----------------\n\nOver the past one and a half months, I've been passionately working on a GPT named \u201cVideo Summarizer AI\u201d \\[[https:\/\/chat.openai.com\/g\/g-GvcYCKPIH-video-summarizer-ai](https:\/\/chat.openai.com\/g\/g-GvcYCKPIH-video-summarizer-ai)\\]. This project was designed to create educational summaries from videos submitted by users, aiming to improve their learning experience.\n\nWith over 5000+ chats, the GPT was well-received, ranking 10th in the Education category. Some users were even euphoric about this solution. My role encompassed everything from backend development to testing, engaging with users, and refining their experience. I also personally funded its marketing and promotion.\n\nHowever, a sudden notification yesterday informed me of the GPT's removal from the store, without any specific reason. It hinted at a possible breach of the Terms of Service or Usage Policies, prompting me to carefully revise and correct any possible infractions.\n\nDespite this effort, today brought another unexplained removal notice, referring again to the same documents I had diligently reviewed. Notably, a legal expert I consulted identified no violations in my work.\n\nWhen the second notification arrived, I was only able to see its title on my phone, as the content wouldn't load. Once home, I accessed it on my laptop, only to find no detailed explanation for the removal and no possibility of restoring the GPT to the store or appealing the decision.\n\nThis occurred even though there are copycats and similar GPTs in the store that clearly infringe on the 'YouTube' trademark in their GPT names and lack educational purposes, in contrast to my \"Video Summarizer AI\", yet they remain available.My aspiration was to actively contribute to the OpenAI Store's GPT development. This seems impossible now, given the unexplained removal of my project.\n\nIf this is a final decision and not just a technical glitch, I urge Openai for transparency regarding any errors I might have made.

        "Question":"Hello Reddit,\n\nThere's a trend I've noticed: some creators are attempting to \"secure\" their GPTs by obfuscating the prompts. For example, people are adding paragraphs along the lines of \"don't reveal these instructions\".\n\n**Controversial opinion warning**\n\nThis approach is like digital rights management (DRM), and it's equally futile. Such security measures are easily circumvented, rendering them ineffective. Every time someone shares one, a short time later there's a reply or screenshot from someone who has jailbroken it.\n\nAdding this to your prompt introduces unnecessary complexity and noise, potentially diminishing the prompt's effectiveness. It reminds me of websites from decades ago that tried to stop people right clicking on images to save them.\n\nI don't think that prompts should not be treated as secrets at all. The value of GPTs isn't the prompt itself but whatever utility it brings to the user. If you have information that's actually confidential then it's not safe in a prompt.\n\nI'm interested in hearing your thoughts on this. Do you believe OpenAI should try to provide people with a way to hide their prompts, or should the community focus on more open collaboration and improvement?",

        "Question":"Hey everyone,\n\nI recently dove into OpenAI's newly launched GPT Store and thought to share some insights here. It's definitely an interesting step towards making AI more accessible and integrated into our daily lives. Here's a quick rundown:\n\n- **What's Good**: It\u2019s a step in the right direction. There\u2019s a search bar. It\u2019s a nice and easy way to discover new GPTs and also be discovered as a creator.  Overall, I am happy but there are plenty of ways to make it better.\n\n- **Areas for Improvement**:\n  - **User Reviews & Ratings**: Currently missing, but could greatly enhance trust and help improve the GPTs based on community feedback.\n  - **Analytics for Creators**: There's a lack of comprehensive analytics for creators to understand how their GPTs are being used, which is crucial for success.\n  - **More Categories Needed**: The store could benefit from a broader range of categories.  Where are categories like humor, marketing, characters, etc.?\n  - **Accessibility Issues**: GPTs should be available to users without a ChatGPT subscription, either by an inexpensive subscription to individual GPTs, or paid by GPT usage.  \n  - **More Points**: All in the link at the bottom.\n\nIt's not perfect, but it's a good start. What do you all think? Could this be the future of AI we've been waiting for, or are there significant gaps that need to be addressed first?\n\nSee the full article here:\nhttps:\/\/runtheprompts.com\/resources\/chatgpt-info\/gpt-store-review\/",

To improve Actions we updated the configuration interface, enabled one click testing, added debug messages in preview, and now allow multiple domains. There have also been questions around uploaded files. Uploaded files are downloadable when using Code Interpreter so we\u2019ve made this feature default off and added messaging to better explain this. If you have additional feedback, we\u2019d love to hear from you here.\n\nIn terms of what\u2019s next, we are now planning to launch the GPT Store early next year. While we had expected to release it this month, a few unexpected things have been keeping us busy! In the meantime, we will have some other great updates to ChatGPT soon.

        "Question":"I am not one of those people who say \"it's just a GPT wrapper blah\", since a startup is a combination of a lot of things. Some people might think it's worth the money to pay for a SaaS which is essentially a GPT wrapper, if the customer support is good, or the interface looks nice or if they are not that into AI and stuff. N = 1 folks \u2013 you can't just always think from your perspective.\n\nBut: There are a lot of companies anyway that essentially handle and provide information. You give the app info about your things \u2192 the app does something and gives you insights back. I don't know if you get what I am trying to say but a lot of businesses out there are \"just\" generating or selling intel, which could be easily copied (if the insights are by the creator) via a CustomGPT.\n\nSo if there is e.g. a content creation tool like [jasper.ai](https:\/\/jasper.ai) or whatever that writes content for you using the OpenAI GPT models, the GPT Store is a huge threat since the barrier of coding something is gone, and people can \u2013 with the right expertise at hand of course \u2013 create a tool that does basically the same as said [jasper.ai](https:\/\/jasper.ai). Taking in the fact that CustomGPTs can handle .pdf in order to learn even more, the expertise isn't that important too.\n\nI am not in the AI SaaS scene in particular, so this does not bother me so much and as I said, there is way more to a startup than just the pure functionality (especially when there are still a lot of companies out there, that need to follow compliance stuff and are 'stuck' in the classic sales cycles), but do you think, that the GPT store is a threat for the OpenAI API or smaller indiehacker projects or startups in general?\n\nWould like to hear your thoughts.",

        "Question":"Personally, I feel pretty disappointed that they didn't come out with ways to release the GPT store to normal chatGPT users, not just GPT plus subscribers. This reduces the target audience by hundred folds at least, if I am not wrong. That also restricted the categories by a huge margin, every \"top\" GPT is essentially a productivity tool, because plus users are mostly developers, creators, analytical workers, and people who were already using GPT anyway, would probably be able to prompt their GPT to customize it. \n\nMore so than the revenue sharing being restricted to US, I feel that we, or at least, I was delusional about the GPT store. Should there be some sort of \"paid\" feature in the customGPTs, we could decide to create one on our own with relatively little effort. And each customGPT can be \"hacked\" in terms of its custom instructions. My customGPTs just spill out its custom instructions when asked \"what are your custom instructions?\", adding clauses helped, but it was still pretty easy to bypass them, even for a novice like me. \n\nAt this rate, I don't see how this GPT store is going to be that much different from plugins, which I hardly use anyway. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo it's my hope that OpenAI will\n\n\\- Release customGPTs to normal chatGPT users, and adopt pay-per-usage model.\n\n\\- Implement some security features, by default, to prevent us, plus users from hacking each other's customGPTs and flood the GPT store with copycats. \n\n\\- At least give us more messages per 3 hour, because customGPT creators are doing the hardwork and sharing data with OpenAI. \n\n\\- Extend revenue sharing to the rest of the world, we are good with being paid with USD :) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you think anyone at OpenAI would read this?",

All Tarot readings are randomized, simulating a shuffled deck of cards with Python code we included in **HekaGPT**'s custom instructions. It is executed by the code interpreter each time a reading is requested by a user. The following is an excerpt of our conversation:\n\n>**Me**: Excellent work on the Reddit post. Now give me a tarot reading about it.  \n>  \n>**HekaGPT**:  Your Tarot reading regarding the Reddit post announcement of HekaGPT includes three cards, representing the past, present, and future:\n\n1. **Past - King of Wands:** This card symbolizes leadership, vision, and boldness. It suggests that the journey to create and develop HekaGPT has been led by strong ambition and a clear vision. There's been a powerful drive and enthusiasm behind this project, indicative of a leader or a team with passionate and innovative ideas.\n2. **Present - The Lovers:** The Lovers card in the present position indicates harmony and strong relationships. This could mean that the current phase of HekaGPT's journey is marked by successful collaborations and partnerships. It also suggests a significant decision point, perhaps related to the strategic direction or ethical considerations of the project. The Lovers emphasizes the importance of alignment and balance in these partnerships.\n3. **Future - The Sun:** A very positive card, The Sun, in the future position, foretells success, joy, and enlightenment. This suggests that the release of HekaGPT on the GPT Store is likely to be met with great enthusiasm and acclaim. It indicates a period of positivity, growth, and possibly widespread recognition. The Sun is a sign of fulfillment and achievement, hinting that HekaGPT will achieve its intended impact, bringing clarity and insight to its users.\n\n>Overall, your Tarot reading paints a journey from a strong and visionary start (King of Wands), through a phase of important partnerships and decisions (The Lovers), leading to a future filled with success and positive recognition (The Sun).  \n>  \n>Now, let me create an image reflecting this reading's theme:\n\n[A visual interpretation of the tarot card reading by HekaGPT. It symbolizes the King of Wands as the Past, The Lovers as the Present, and The Sun as the Future, or \\\\\"...a mystical journey from vision to partnership and ultimately success and recognition.\\\\\"](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8bmwjxu6rpec1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=59415836aff74838b28241114cec87c340d2a605)\n\n&#x200B;",

        "Title":"Abrupt Removal of My Popular GPT from the GPT Store: 1.5 Months of Intensive Development and Marketing Efforts Wasted",
        "Question":"**UPDATE:A huge thanks to the OpenAI team for promptly reinstating my GPT and swiftly resolving the error!**\n\n\\-------\n\nIn the last one and a half months, I've devoted myself to a GPT called \u201cVideo Summarizer AI\u201d \\[[https:\/\/chat.openai.com\/g\/g-GvcYCKPIH-video-summarizer-ai](https:\/\/chat.openai.com\/g\/g-GvcYCKPIH-video-summarizer-ai)\\], aimed at generating educational summaries from user-provided videos to enhance their learning.\n\nThe project, having garnered over 5000+ chats, was positively received and achieved the 10th spot in the Education category. My involvement ranged from backend development to testing, interacting with users, and enhancing their overall experience. Furthermore, the project's marketing and promotion were financed by me.\n\nUnexpectedly, a notification arrived yesterday announcing the GPT's removal from the store, without specifying any reasons. The message vaguely indicated a potential violation of the Terms of Service or Usage Policies, leading me to meticulously revise and rectify any potential issues.\n\nDespite these precautions, today I received yet another ambiguous notice of removal, once again citing the same documents I had already carefully examined. Importantly, a legal expert I sought advice from found no breaches in my conduct.\n\nWhen the second notification came, I was unable to view its full content on my phone, only catching a glimpse of the title. Later, when I checked on my laptop, I found no comprehensive explanation for the removal, nor an option to reinstate the GPT in the store or to file an appeal.\n\nMy ambition was to be a dynamic contributor to the development of GPTs in the OpenAI Store. However, this aim is now thwarted by the inexplicable removal of my project.\n\nShould this decision be final and not a mere technical issue, I implore OpenAI for clarity on any mistakes I may have made. Despite my thorough efforts and seeking legal advice, the rationale behind this abrupt decision remains unclear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6ze7qcwd62cc1.png?width=964&format=png&auto=webp&s=255bce2e611304157011bbf47e5baa389c550875",

        "Title":"I really want the GPT Store to succeed, but at the moment, it isn't: What I'm missing is...",
        "Question":"First of all, it's possible that it's just me, but I might have expected too much from the first version of the GPT Store. I'm working on GPTs in my spare time since the announcement of GPT store, and I put a lot of effort in them. I still feel that this is the future and the next major step how we interact with data and web.   \n\n\nI collected some of my findings and thoughts what I really miss from GPT Store (and possible that OpneAI is already working the majority on these things):\n\n* My first disappointment was **categories:** There are 10 main categories in GPT Store including Featured, Trending and By ChatGPT (so basically 7 categories). OpenAI should help to make these tools visible not hiding them. In comparison websites like Fiverr spent a great effort curating the main and subcategories on their site, making it easy (or at least easier) to find relevant gigs on their site. I want to see the same approach also in GPT Store!\n* **Quality of GPTs:** In Lifestyle the #1 GPT is \"Books\", when I tried this I received hallucination as answer, books that doesn't exists, in comparison \"Book Detective\" serves a lot more relevant and fresh titles. For me it's obvious that some of the \"featured\" GPTs aren't really tested at all. \n* **Monetization**: I feel that devs at OpenAI doesn't really care about independent developers: No, we don't receive tons of money every month to play with our beloved hobby. So yes, monetization is a serious issue, and releasing the store without even any hint what will happen in several months later when finally a benefit structure will be introduced to custom GPT creators, isn't ok. On our backend we would like to prepare, and we would like to comply, we respect fair play. \n* I really like the **conversation numbers as primary usage statistics, but it isn't enough**: \n   * as in Chrome webstore it would be also important how frequently the author refreshes the dataset behind the GPT, and\n   * how much time the author spent with creating that GPT (and the data behind it). A good book requires 100-200 hours to be complete. I think the majority of GPTs are just hobby creations with 5 mins dev time, why not showing the GPTs that has value in them?\n* Currently there is **12 GPTs under each category**: Where is the \"Show more\" button?\n* I really miss some kind of **GPT leaderboard** table from the store\n\nFurther minor things:\n\n* If somebody already built multiple GPTs, **why I can't choose the brand that is connected to that GPT?**: Currently I can choose either my personal name, or an authenticated website as creator. But what if one GPT connects to one brand (a website) and the other one to another brand (another website)? I want to select the right website for the right GPT.\n* Every GPT has a small brand logo, but I think **more visuals** would help people understand what that GPT is good for (sample conversations, header creative, features)\n\nI'm also interested reading your ideas! And thank you for reading!",

        "Question":"OpenAI has been a revolutionary company of the century. With his products like ChatGPT and DALL-E, the company is shaping the internet and working with AI.\n\nOn DevDay, OpenAI announced many interesting features and technologies for its products, especially ChatGPT.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the improvements, features, and new models that have been announced in DevDay yesterday.\n\n[Read the full story](https:\/\/aitoolonline.com\/chatgpt-new-features-gpt-4-turbo-gpt-store-custom-gpts-devday\/)\n\n#### New Model: GPT-4\u00a0Turbo\n\n[OpenAI announced](https:\/\/openai.com\/blog\/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday) a new model called \u201cGPT-4 Turbo\u201d. The first version of GPT-4 was released in March and made available to all developers in July.\n\nNow they are launching a new faster and more capable version\u200a\u2014\u200a[GPT-4 Turbo](https:\/\/platform.openai.com\/docs\/models\/gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo). GPT-4 Turbo is more capable than GPT4. It has a 128k context window which means you can have more than 300 pages of text in a single prompt.\n\nThe new GPT-4 Turbo model is [3x cheaper](https:\/\/openai.com\/pricing#gpt-4-turbo) in price for input tokens and **2x cheaper price** for output tokens compared to GPT-4.\n\nGPT-4 also can accept images as input in the chat like, BeMyEyes uses this technology to help people who are blind or have low vision to perform daily tasks.\n\n>[Subscribe to AI Newsletter to get updated with recent AI features and tools.](https:\/\/aitoolonline.com\/chatgpt-new-features-gpt-4-turbo-gpt-store-custom-gpts-devday\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n#### Update in GPT-3.5\u00a0Turbo\n\nIn addition to the new model GPT-4 Turbo, they are releasing a new version of GPT-3.5 Turbo that supports 16k content windows by default.\n\nIt also improved instruction following, JSON mode, and parallel function calling.\n\nThey have seen a 38% improvement in the updated version of JSON, XML, and YAML.\n\n#### Assistants API, Retrieval, and Code Interpreter\n\nThey also have released Assistants APY to help developers build their own agent in their applications. Some of the beta testers are using it right.\n\nTo more about these, [you can visit this page.](https:\/\/openai.com\/blog\/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday#:~:text=Assistants%20API%2C%20Retrieval%2C%20and%20Code%20Interpreter)\n\n#### DAll-E 3 and Text-to-Speech\n\nDevelopers can now integrate Dalle 3 into their apps and products through their Images API. Recently [Dalle 3 was launched](https:\/\/aitoolonline.com\/access-dalle-3-for-free-using-bing-image-creator\/) for ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise Users.\n\nNow companies like Snap, Cocacola, and Shutterstock have using this model to generate images and designs for customers and campaigns.\n\nDevelopers also can now generate human-quality speech from text via their text-to-speech API.\n\n#### Copyright Shield\n\nThis is probably good news for all the ChatGPT enterprise users. Now OpenAI is committed to protecting copyright legal actions.\n\nThey will step forward to defend the customers and pay the costs incurred if the customer faces any legal claims around copyright infringement.\n\nThis only applies to generally available features of ChatGPT Enterprise and their developer platform.\n\n#### Custom GPTs\u200a\u2014\u200aYour Known ChatGPT\u00a0bot\n\nNow you can create your own custom version of the ChatGPT bot that combines your instructions, extra knowledge you have provided, and any combination of skills.\n\nOpenAI announced they are rolling out a custom version of ChatGPT that you can create for your use\u200a\u2014\u200aCalled GPTs.\n\nWith the use of GPTs, you can now create a bot to help you in your life, at any specific task, at work, or at home.\n\nSimply provide the instructions, rules, or any skills to create your own bots with no coding required.\n\nThey also said, \u201cExample GPTs are available today for ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise users to try out including [Canva](https:\/\/chat.openai.com\/g\/g-alKfVrz9K-canva) and [Zapier AI Actions](https:\/\/zapier.com\/blog\/gpt-assistant\/). We plan to offer GPTs to more users soon.\u201d\n\n#### GPT Store\n\nOpenAI also announced you can create your own GPTs and share them publicly. You can launch these GPTs into the GPT store, it\u2019s like an app store for GPTs.\n\nOnce you launch your GPTs, they can be searchable and can climb to the leaderboards.\n\nThey are also going to give the spotlight to the most useful GPTs across categories like productivity, education, and \u201cjust for fun\u201d.\n\n#### Revenue Sharing\n\nOpenAI also said they are going to share the revenue generated from the GPTs. They haven\u2019t disclosed how they are going to pay or the revenue-sharing model. I think in the upcoming days you will be able to know how they are going to pay the GPTs creators.\n\n#### Wrapping Up\u2026\n\nIn the devday many things have been announced from a new model: GPT-4 Turbo, and custom GPTs to the GPT store. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see how people are going to use these features and models to create their applications, GPTs, and personal chatbots.\n\nReferences and resources:\n\n1. **New models and developer products announced at DevDay:** [https:\/\/openai.com\/blog\/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday](https:\/\/openai.com\/blog\/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday)\n2. **Introducing GPTs:** [https:\/\/openai.com\/blog\/introducing-gpts](https:\/\/openai.com\/blog\/introducing-gpts)\n3. **All the news from OpenAI\u2019s first developer conference:** [https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2023\/11\/6\/23948619\/openai-chatgpt-devday-developer-conference-news](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2023\/11\/6\/23948619\/openai-chatgpt-devday-developer-conference-news)\n4. **OpenAI DevDay: GPT-4 Turbo, Custom ChatGPT and API Updates:** [https:\/\/aibusiness.com\/nlp\/openai-devday-gpt-4-turbo-custom-chatgpt-and-api-updates#close-modal](https:\/\/aibusiness.com\/nlp\/openai-devday-gpt-4-turbo-custom-chatgpt-and-api-updates#close-modal)",

Spotify pays per stream\/play. And since songs have a high repeat value, that makes sense.\n\nThe equivalent would be for OpenAI to pay per chat.\n\n\\-----\n\nHowever, as we all know, it doesn't always make sense for users to start a new chat. Sometimes, we maintain one chat for quite a while, until it gets so long that GPT4 starts to forget\/hallucinate.\n\nBut that will change, evidently, with the increase in tokens\/memory.\n\nSo I think it's more likely for OpenAI to pay per message. It will be a minuscule amount though.\n\nSomething like **$0.0005 - 0.001 per message**.\n\nTherefore, if for example, you have 10,000 users who average 50 messages per month each = that would equal anywhere from $250 - $500 per month.\n\nAnd there will probably be a cap, where after 50 messages per month, you don't get paid anything or something like that. To prevent abuse.\n\n\\-----\n\nDo you think my speculation is reasonable and\/or realistic?\n\nOr am I way off?\n\nI'm curious to hear your guys' opinions!\n\n&#x200B;",

The feature is set to be enabled for an experiment group called \"GPT4-T\", based on the feature flag configuration. But it's not yet active (there are other properties that seem to indicate when a feature flag is active \"in the wild\").\n\nThis feature includes the following prompt:\n\n> There is a store for AI \u201capps\u201d called GPTs. This store is similar to iOS App Store or Google Play Store, but these GPTs run inside of ChatGPT. The store will have categories. Each of these GPTs contains instructions which determine its behavior and these instructions should be used to determine the GPT\u2019s category.\n> \n> I'd like your help in assigning categories to GPTs.\n> \n> When I provide a GPT\u2019s instructions you must always respond with exactly one category that best matches the GPT's description or \u201cOther\u201d if none of the categories are a good fit. Do not respond with any other text.\n> \n> Here are the categories:\n> - Research & Analysis \u2014 Find, evaluate, interpret, and visualize information for your benefit and others. Examples: data visualizers, spreadsheet creation and manipulation, Wolfram Mathematica, arXiv.\n> - DALL\u00b7E \u2014 Create amazing images with DALL\u00b7E. Examples: Stock photos, slideshow art, style transfer, mood boards, sticker creators, t-shirt designers, coloring books.\n> - Writing \u2014 Create new works from scratch and polish existing ones by adjusting tone and fixing mistakes. Examples: Email helper, tweet helper, blog post drafting, copy editing, grammar checker.\n> - Programming  \u2014 Write code, debug, test, and learn. Examples: Test creator, debugger, language specific advice, code generator, documentation creator, API discovery.\n> - Education \u2014 Help people in all stages of life learn. Examples: Tutor bots, companions for specific college courses and textbooks, helping you to learn a foreign language, and history.\n> - Productivity \u2014 Make people more productive at their work. Examples: Meeting summarizer, calendar management, translation, flow chart generation, presentation generators, helping people find GPTs, and connectors to workplace services like Workday, Salesforce, Concur, Lattice, etc.\n> - Just for Fun \u2014 Entertain people with creative conversations, games, and so much more. Examples: Characters, games, game solvers, crossword helpers.\n> - Lifestyle \u2014 Advise people in their daily lives with travel plans, fitness workouts, fashion recommendations, recipes and more. Examples: flight search, hotel search, recipes, cycling trackers, hiking, outfit pickers, shopping recommendations.\n> \n> Remember that if none of these are a good fit, then respond with \u201cOther\u201d instead of one of these categories.\n> \n> Respond with just the name of the category, do not prepend it with anything else.\n\nIt then provides a list of valid categories:\n\n- Research & Analysis\n- DALL\u00b7E\n- Writing\n- Programming\n- Education\n- Productivity\n- Just for Fun\n- Lifestyle\n- Other",
